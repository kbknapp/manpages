This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
head
-- copy the first part of files
SYNOPSIS
head [-n number] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
The
head
utility shall copy its input files to the standard output, ending the
output for each file at a designated point.

Copying shall end at the point in each input file indicated by the
-n
number
option. The option-argument
number
shall be counted in units of lines.
OPTIONS
The
head
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following option shall be supported:
-n number 10
The first
number
lines of each input file shall be copied to standard output. The
application shall ensure that the
number
option-argument is a positive decimal integer.

When a file contains less than
number
lines, it shall be copied to standard output in its entirety. This
shall not be an error.

If no options are specified,
head
shall act as if
-n 10
had been specified.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
file 10
A pathname of an input file. If no
file
operands are specified, the standard input shall be used.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used if no
file
operands are specified, and shall be used if a
file
operand is
'-' 
and the implementation treats the
'-' 
as meaning standard input.
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
See the INPUT FILES section.
INPUT FILES
Input files shall be text files, but the line length is not restricted
to
{LINE_MAX}
bytes.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
head :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The standard output shall contain designated portions of the input
files.

If multiple
file
operands are specified,
head
shall precede the output for each with the header:
"\n==> %s <==\n", <pathname>
except that the first header written shall not include the initial
<newline>.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
To write the first ten lines of all files (except those with a leading
period) in the directory:
head -- *
RATIONALE
Although it is possible to simulate
head
with
sed
10q for a single file, the standard developers decided that the
popularity of
head
on historical BSD systems warranted its inclusion alongside
tail .

POSIX.1-2008 version of
head
follows the Utility Syntax Guidelines. The
-n
option was added to this new interface so that
head
and
tail
would be more logically related. Earlier versions of this standard
allowed a
-number
option. This form is no longer specified by POSIX.1-2008 but may
be present in some implementations.

There is no
-c
option (as there is in
tail )
because it is not historical practice and because other utilities in
this volume of POSIX.1-2008 provide similar functionality.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
