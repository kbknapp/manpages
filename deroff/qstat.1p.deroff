NAME
qstat
-- show status of batch jobs
SYNOPSIS
qstat [-f] job_identifier...

qstat -Q [-f] destination...

qstat -B [-f] server_name...

DESCRIPTION
The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is obtained by
a request to the server. The
qstat
utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests the status of
one or more batch jobs, batch queues, or servers, and writes the status
information to standard output.

For each successfully processed batch
job_identifier ,
the
qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding batch job.

For each successfully processed destination, the
qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding batch queue.

For each successfully processed server name, the
qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding server.

The
qstat
utility shall acquire batch job status information by sending a
Job Status Request
to a batch server. The
qstat
utility shall acquire batch queue status information by sending a
Queue Status Request
to a batch server. The
qstat
utility shall acquire server status information by sending a
Server Status Request
to a batch server.
OPTIONS
The
qstat
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
-f 10
Specify that a full display is produced.
The minimum contents of a full display are specified in the STDOUT
section.

Additional contents and format of a full display are
implementation-defined.

-Q 10
Specify that the operand is a destination.
The
qstat
utility shall display information about each batch queue at each
destination identified as an operand.

-B 10
Specify that the operand is a server name.
The
qstat
utility shall display information about each server identified as an
operand.

OPERANDS
If the
-Q
option is presented to the
qstat
utility, the utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to
the syntax for a destination (see
Section 3.3.2 ,  Destination).

If the
-B
option is presented to the
qstat
utility, the utility shall accept one or more
server_name
operands.

If neither the
-B
nor the
-Q
option is presented to the
qstat
utility, the utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to
the syntax for a batch
job_identifier
(see
Section 3.3.1 ,  Batch Job Identifier).
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
qstat :
HOME 10
Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_COLLATE 10

Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes,
and multi-character collating elements within regular expressions.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
LC_NUMERIC 10

Determine the locale for selecting the radix character used when
writing floating-point formatted output.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.

qstat
utility shall display the following items for each success fully
processed operand:
 * 4
The batch
job_identifier
 * 4
The batch job name
 * 4
The
Job_Owner
attribute
 * 4
The execution user ID
 * 4
The CPU time used by the batch job
 * 4
The batch job state
 * 4
The batch job location
 * 4
Additional implementation-defined information, if any, about the
batch job or batch queue

If an operand presented to the
qstat
utility is a destination, the
-Q
option is specified, and the

option is not specified, the
qstat
utility shall display the following items on a single line, in the
stated order, with white space between each item, for each successfully
processed operand:
 * 4

 * 4
The maximum number of batch jobs that shall be run in the batch
queue concurrently
 * 4
The total number of batch jobs in the batch queue
 * 4
The status of the batch queue
 * 4
For each state, the number of batch jobs in that state in the batch
queue and the name of the state
 * 4
The type of batch queue (execution or routing)

If the operands presented to the
qstat
utility are destinations, the
-Q
option is specified, and the
-f
option is specified, the
qstat
utility shall display the following items for each successfully
processed operand:
 * 4

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
In addition to the default behavior, the
qstat
utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates that
the batch
job_identifier
does not exist on the server. Whether or not the
qstat
utility waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to
locate the batch job on other servers is implementation-defined.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The
qstat
utility allows users to display the status of jobs and list the
batch jobs in queues.

The operands of the
qstat
utility may be either job identifiers, queues (specified as destination
identifiers), or batch server names. The
-Q
and
-B
options, or absence thereof, indicate the nature of the operands.

The other options of the
qstat
utility allow the user to control the amount of information displayed
and the format in which it is displayed. Should a user wish to display
the status of a set of jobs that match a selection criteria, the
qselect
utility may be used to acquire such a list.

The
-f
option allows users to request a ``full'' display in an
implementation-defined format.

Historically, the
qstat
utility has been a part of the NQS and its derivatives, the existing
practice on which it is based.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The
qstat
utility may be removed in a future version.
