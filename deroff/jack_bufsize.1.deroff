NAME
jack_bufsize - JACK toolkit client to change the JACK buffer size
SYNOPSIS
jack_bufsize bufsize
DESCRIPTION
jack_bufsize
jack_bufsize sets the size of the buffer (frames per period) used in JACK. 
This change happens on-line (the JACK server and its clients do not need to be 
restarted).

When invoked without arguments, it prints the current bufsize, and exits.
