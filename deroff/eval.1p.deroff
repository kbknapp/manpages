NAME
eval
-- construct command by concatenating arguments
SYNOPSIS
eval [argument...]

DESCRIPTION
The
eval
utility shall construct a command by concatenating
argument s
together, separating each with a
<space>
character.
The constructed command shall be read and executed by the shell.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
See the DESCRIPTION.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
None.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
Not used.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
If there are no
argument s,
or only null
argument s,
eval
shall return a zero exit status; otherwise, it shall return the exit
status of the command defined by the string of concatenated
argument s
separated by
<space>
characters, or a non-zero exit status if the concatenation could not
be parsed as a command and the shell is interactive (and therefore did
not abort).
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
Since
eval
is not required to recognize the
"--" 
end of options delimiter, in cases where the argument(s) to
eval
might begin with
'-' 
it is recommended that the first argument is prefixed by a string that
will not alter the commands to be executed, such as a
<space>
character:
eval " $commands"
or:
eval " $(some_command)"
EXAMPLES
foo=10 x=foo
y='$'$x
echo $y
$foo
eval y='$'$x
echo $y
10

RATIONALE
This standard allows, but does not require,
eval
to recognize
"--" .
Although this means applications cannot use
"--" 
to protect against options supported as an extension (or errors reported
for unsupported options), the nature of the
eval
utility is such that other means can be used to provide this protection
(see APPLICATION USAGE above).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
