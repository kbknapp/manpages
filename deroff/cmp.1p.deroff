NAME
cmp
-- compare two files
SYNOPSIS
cmp [-l|-s] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
The
cmp
utility shall compare two files. The
cmp
utility shall write no output if the files are the same. Under default
options, if they differ, it shall write to standard output the byte and
line number at which the first difference occurred. Bytes and lines
shall be numbered beginning with 1.
OPTIONS
The
cmp
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-l 10
(Lowercase ell.) Write the byte number (decimal) and the differing
bytes (octal) for each difference.
-s 10
Write nothing for differing files; return exit status only.
OPERANDS
The following operands shall be supported:
file1 10
A pathname of the first file to be compared. If
file1
is
'-' ,
the standard input shall be used.
file2 10
A pathname of the second file to be compared. If
file2
is
'-' ,
the standard input shall be used.

If both
file1
and
file2
refer to standard input or refer to the same FIFO special, block
special, or character special file, the results are undefined.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if the
file1
or
file2
operand refers to standard input. See the INPUT FILES section.
INPUT FILES
The input files can be any file type.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
cmp :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and
informative messages written to standard output.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
In the POSIX locale, results of the comparison shall be written to
standard output. When no options are used, the format shall be:
"%s %s differ: char %d, line %d\n", file1, file2,
    <byte number>, <line number>
When the
-l
option is used, the format shall be:
"%d %o %o\n", <byte number>, <differing byte>,
    <differing byte>
for each byte that differs. The first <differing byte> number is
from
file1
while the second is from
file2 .
In both cases, <byte number> shall be relative to the beginning
of the file, beginning with 1.

No output shall be written to standard output when the
-s
option is used.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages. If the
-l
option is used and
file1
and
file2
differ in length, or if the
-s
option is not used and
file1
and
file2
are identical for the entire length of the shorter file, in the POSIX
locale the following diagnostic message shall be written:
"cmp: EOF on %s%s\n", <name of shorter file>, <additional info>
The <additional info> field shall either be null or a string
that starts with a
<blank>
and contains no
<newline>
characters. Some implementations report on the number of lines in
this case.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
The files are identical.
 1 6
The files are different; this includes the case where one file is
identical to the first part of the other.
>1 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
Although input files to
cmp
can be any type, the results might not be what would be expected on
character special device files or on file types not described by the
System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2008. Since this volume of POSIX.1-2008 does not specify the block size used when doing
input, comparisons of character special files need not compare all of
the data in those files.

For files which are not text files, line numbers simply reflect the
presence of a
<newline>,
without any implication that the file is organized into lines.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The global language in
Section 1.4 ,  Utility Description Defaults
indicates that using two mutually-exclusive options together produces
unspecified results. Some System V implementations consider the option
usage:
cmp -l -s ...
to be an error. They also treat:
cmp -s -l ...
as if no options were specified. Both of these behaviors are
considered bugs, but are allowed.

The word
char
in the standard output format comes from historical usage, even though
it is actually a byte number. When
cmp
is supported in other locales, implementations are encouraged to use
the word
byte
or its equivalent in another language. Users should not interpret this
difference to indicate that the functionality of the utility changed
between locales.

Some implementations report on the number of lines in the
identical-but-shorter file case. This is allowed by the inclusion of
the <additional info> fields in the output format. The
restriction on having a leading
<blank>
and no
<newline>
characters is to make parsing for the filename easier. It is recognized
that some filenames containing white-space characters make parsing
difficult anyway, but the restriction does aid programs used on systems
where the names are predominantly well behaved.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
