NAME
xdg-email - command line tool for sending mail using the users preferred e-mail composer
SYNOPSIS

xdg-email [--utf8] [--cc address] [--bcc address] [--subject text] [--body text] [--attach file] [mailto-uri | address(es)]

xdg-email {--help | --manual | --version}
DESCRIPTION

xdg-email opens the users preferred e-mail composer in order to send a mail to
address(es)
or
mailto-uri. RFC2368 defines mailto: URIs. xdg-email limits support to, cc, subject and body fields in
mailto-uri, all other fields are silently ignored.
address(es)
must follow the syntax of RFC822. Multiple addresses may be provided as separate arguments.

All information provided on the command line is used to prefill corresponding fields in the users e-mail composer. The user will have the opportunity to change any of this information before actually sending the e-mail.

xdg-email is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use xdg-email as root.
OPTIONS

--utf8

Indicates that all command line options that follow are in utf8. Without this option, command line options are expected to be encoded according to locale. If the locale already specifies utf8 this option has no effect. This option does not affect mailto URIs that are passed on the command line.
--cc address

Specify a recipient to be copied on the e-mail.
--bcc address

Specify a recipient to be blindly copied on the e-mail.
--subject text

Specify a subject for the e-mail.
--body text

Specify a body for the e-mail. Since the user will be able to make changes before actually sending the e-mail, this can be used to provide the user with a template for the e-mail.
text
may contain linebreaks.
--attach file

Specify an attachment for the e-mail.
file
must point to an existing file.

Some e-mail applications require the file to remain present after xdg-email returns.
--help

Show command synopsis.
--manual

Show this manual page.
--version

Show the xdg-utils version information.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

xdg-email honours the following environment variables:
