NAME
zcat
-- expand and concatenate data
SYNOPSIS
zcat [file...]

DESCRIPTION
The
zcat
utility shall write to standard output the uncompressed form of files
that have been compressed using the
compress
utility. It is the equivalent of
uncompress
-c .
Input files are not affected.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
file 10
The pathname of a file previously processed by the
compress
utility. If
file
already has the
.Z
suffix specified, it is used as submitted. Otherwise, the
.Z
suffix is appended to the filename prior to processing.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if no
file
operands are specified, or if a
file
operand is
'-' .
INPUT FILES
Input files shall be compressed files that are in the format produced by
the
compress
utility.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
zcat :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The compressed files given as input shall be written on standard output
in their uncompressed form.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
