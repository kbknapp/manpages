NAME
test
-- evaluate expression
SYNOPSIS
test [expression]

[ [expression] ]

DESCRIPTION
The
test
utility shall evaluate the
expression
and indicate the result of the evaluation by its exit status. An exit
status of zero indicates that the expression evaluated as true and an
exit status of 1 indicates that the expression evaluated as false.

In the second form of the utility, which uses
"[]" 
rather than
test ,
the application shall ensure that the square brackets are separate
arguments.
OPTIONS
The
test
utility shall not recognize the
"--" 
argument in the manner specified by Guideline 10 in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

No options shall be supported.
OPERANDS
The application shall ensure that all operators and elements of
primaries are presented as separate arguments to the
test
utility.

The following primaries can be used to construct
expression :
-b pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to en existing directory entry for a block special file.
False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a block
special file.
-c pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a character special file.
False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a character
special file.
-d pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a directory. False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a
directory.
-e pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry. False if
pathname
cannot be resolved.
-f pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a regular file. False if

True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a symbolic link. False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a symbolic

True if the length of
string
is non-zero; otherwise, false.

True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a FIFO. False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a FIFO.

to read from the file will be granted, as defined in
Section 1.1.1.4 ,  File Read ,  Write ,  and Creation.
False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file for which permission
to read from the file will not be granted.

cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a socket.
-s pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that has a size
greater than zero. False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that does not have
a size greater than zero.
-t file_descriptor 10

True if file descriptor number
file_descriptor
is open and is associated with a terminal. False if
file_descriptor
is not a valid file descriptor number, or if file descriptor number
file_descriptor
is not open, or if it is open but is not associated with a terminal.
-u pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that has its
set-user-ID flag set. False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that does not have
its set-user-ID flag set.
-w pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file for which permission
to write to the file will be granted, as defined in
Section 1.1.1.4 ,  File Read ,  Write ,  and Creation.
False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file for which permission
to write to the file will not be granted.
-x pathname 10
True if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file for which permission
to execute the file (or search it, if it is a directory) will be granted,
as defined in
Section 1.1.1.4 ,  File Read ,  Write ,  and Creation.
False if
pathname
cannot be resolved, or if
pathname
resolves to an existing directory entry for a file for which permission
to execute (or search) the file will not be granted.
-z string 10
True if the length of string
string
is zero; otherwise, false.
string 10
True if the string
string
is not the null string; otherwise, false.
s1 = s2 10
True if the strings
s1
and
s2
are identical; otherwise, false.
s1 != s2 10
True if the strings
s1
and
s2
are not identical; otherwise, false.
n1 -eq n2 10
True if the integers
n1
and
n2
are algebraically equal; otherwise, false.
n1 -ne n2 10
True if the integers
n1
and
n2
are not algebraically equal; otherwise, false.
n1 -gt n2 10
True if the integer
n1
is algebraically greater than the integer
n2 ;
otherwise, false.
n1 -ge n2 10
True if the integer
n1
is algebraically greater than or equal to the integer
n2 ;
otherwise, false.
n1 -lt n2 10
True if the integer
n1
is algebraically less than the integer
n2 ;
otherwise, false.
n1 -le n2 10
True if the integer
n1
is algebraically less than or equal to the integer
n2 ;
otherwise, false.
expression1 -a expression2 10

True if both
expression1
and
expression2
are true; otherwise, false. The
-a
binary primary is left associative. It has a higher precedence than
-o .
expression1 -o expression2 10

True if either
expression1
or
expression2
is true; otherwise, false. The
-o
binary primary is left associative.

With the exception of the
-h
pathname
and
-L
pathname
primaries, if a
pathname
argument is a symbolic link,
test
shall evaluate the expression by resolving the symbolic link and using
the file referenced by the link.

These primaries can be combined with the following operators:
! expression 10
True if
expression
is false. False if
expression
is true.
( expression ) 10
True if
expression
is true. False if
expression
is false. The parentheses can be used to alter the normal precedence
and associativity.

The primaries with two elements of the form:
-primary_operator primary_operand
are known as
unary primaries .
The primaries with three elements in either of the two forms:
primary_operand -primary_operator primary_operand

primary_operand primary_operator primary_operand
are known as
binary primaries .
Additional implementation-defined operators and
primary_operator s
may be provided by implementations. They shall be of the form -c
operator
where the first character of
operator
is not a digit.

The algorithm for determining the precedence of the operators and the
return value that shall be generated is based on the number of
arguments presented to
test .
(However, when using the
"[...]" 
form, the
<right-square-bracket>
final argument shall not be counted in this algorithm.)

In the following list, $1, $2, $3, and $4 represent the arguments
presented to
test :
0 arguments: 12
Exit false (1).
1 argument: 12
Exit true (0) if $1 is not null; otherwise, exit false.
2 arguments: 12
 * 4
If $1 is
'!' ,
exit true if $2 is null, false if $2 is not null.
 * 4
If $1 is a unary primary, exit true if the unary test is true, false if
the unary test is false.
 * 4
Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

3 arguments: 12
 * 4
If $2 is a binary primary, perform the binary test of $1 and $3.
 * 4
If $1 is
'!' ,
negate the two-argument test of $2 and $3.
 * 4
If $1 is
'(' 
and $3 is
')' ,
perform the unary test of $2.
On systems that do not support the XSI option, the results are
unspecified if $1 is
'(' 
and $3 is
')' .
 * 4
Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

4 arguments: 12
 * 4
If $1 is
'!' ,
negate the three-argument test of $2, $3, and $4.
 * 4
If $1 is
'(' 
and $4 is
')' ,
perform the two-argument test of $2 and $3.
On systems that do not support the XSI option, the results are
unspecified if $1 is
'(' 
and $4 is
')' .
 * 4
Otherwise, the results are unspecified.

>4 arguments: 12
The results are unspecified.
On XSI-conformant systems, combinations of primaries and operators
shall be evaluated using the precedence and associativity rules
described previously. In addition, the string comparison binary
primaries
'=' 
and
"!=" 
shall have a higher precedence than any unary primary.

STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
test :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
Not used.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
expression
evaluated to true.
 1 6
expression
evaluated to false or
expression
was missing.
>1 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
The XSI extensions specifying the
-a
and
-o
binary primaries and the
'(' 
and
')' 
operators have been marked obsolescent. (Many expressions using them
are ambiguously defined by the grammar depending on the specific
expressions being evaluated.) Scripts using these expressions should be
converted to the forms given below. Even though many implementations
will continue to support these obsolescent forms, scripts should be
extremely careful when dealing with user-supplied input that could be
confused with these and other primaries and operators. Unless the
application developer knows all the cases that produce input to the
script, invocations like:
test "$1" -a "$2"
should be written as:
test "$1" && test "$2"
to avoid problems if a user supplied values such as $1 set to
'!' 
and $2 set to the null string. That is, in cases where maximal
portability is of concern, replace:
test expr1 -a expr2
with:
test expr1 && test expr2
and replace:
test expr1 -o expr2
with:
test expr1 || test expr2
but note that, in
test ,
-a
has higher precedence than
-o
while
"&&" 
and
"||" 
have equal precedence in the shell.

Parentheses or braces can be used in the shell command language to
effect grouping.

Parentheses must be escaped when using
sh ;
for example:
test \( expr1 -a expr2 \) -o expr3
This command is not always portable even on XSI-conformant systems
depending on the expressions specified by
expr 1,
expr 2,
and
expr 3.
The following form can be used instead:
( test expr1 && test expr2 ) || test expr3
The two commands:
test "$1"
test ! "$1"
could not be used reliably on some historical systems. Unexpected
results would occur if such a
string
expression were used and $1 expanded to
'!' ,
'(' ,
or a known unary primary. Better constructs are:
test -n "$1"
test -z "$1"
respectively.

Historical systems have also been unreliable given the common
construct:
test "$response" = "expected string"
One of the following is a more reliable form:
test "X$response" = "Xexpected string"
test "expected string" = "$response"
Note that the second form assumes that
expected string
could not be confused with any unary primary. If
expected string
starts with
'-' ,
'(' ,
'!' ,
or even
'=' ,
the first form should be used instead. Using the preceding rules
without the XSI marked extensions, any of the three comparison forms is
reliable, given any input. (However, note that the strings are quoted
in all cases.)

Because the string comparison binary primaries,
'=' 
and
"!=" ,
have a higher precedence than any unary primary in the greater than 4
argument case, unexpected results can occur if arguments are not
properly prepared. For example, in:
test -d $1 -o -d $2
If $1 evaluates to a possible directory name of
'=' ,
the first three arguments are considered a string comparison, which
shall cause a syntax error when the second
-d
is encountered. One of the following forms prevents this; the second
is preferred:
test \( -d "$1" \) -o \( -d "$2" \)
test -d "$1" || test -d "$2"
Also in the greater than 4 argument case:
test "$1" = "bat" -a "$2" = "ball"
syntax errors occur if $1 evaluates to
'(' 
or
'!' .
One of the following forms prevents this; the third is preferred:
test "X$1" = "Xbat" -a "X$2" = "Xball"
test "$1" = "bat" && test "$2" = "ball"
test "X$1" = "Xbat" && test "X$2" = "Xball"
EXAMPLES
 1. 4
Exit if there are not two or three arguments (two variations):
if [ $# -ne 2 ] && [ $# -ne 3 ]; then exit 1; fi
if [ $# -lt 2 ] || [ $# -gt 3 ]; then exit 1; fi
 2. 4
Perform a
mkdir
if a directory does not exist:
test ! -d tempdir && mkdir tempdir
 3. 4
Wait for a file to become non-readable:
while test -r thefile
do
    sleep 30
done
echo '"thefile" is no longer readable'
 4. 4
Perform a command if the argument is one of three strings (two
variations):
if [ "$1" = "pear" ] || [ "$1" = "grape" ] || [ "$1" = "apple" ]
then
    command
fi

case "$1" in
    pear|grape|apple) command ;;
esac
RATIONALE
The KornShell-derived conditional command (double bracket
[[]] )
was removed from the shell command language description in an early
proposal. Objections were raised that the real problem is misuse of the
test
command (c
[ ),
and putting it into the shell is the wrong way to fix the problem.
Instead, proper documentation and a new shell reserved word (c
! )
are sufficient.

Tests that require multiple
test
operations can be done at the shell level using individual invocations
of the
test
command and shell logicals, rather than using the error-prone
-o
flag of
test .

XSI-conformant systems support more than four arguments.

XSI-conformant systems support the combining of primaries with the
following constructs:
expression1 -a expression2 6

True if both
expression1
and
expression2
are true.
expression1 -o expression2 6

True if at least one of
expression1
and
expression2
are true.
( expression ) 6

True if
expression
is true.

In evaluating these more complex combined expressions, the following
precedence rules are used:
 * 4
The unary primaries have higher precedence than the algebraic binary
primaries.
 * 4
The unary primaries have lower precedence than the string binary
primaries.
 * 4
The unary and binary primaries have higher precedence than the unary
string
primary.
 * 4
The
!
operator has higher precedence than the
-a
operator, and the
-a
operator has higher precedence than the
-o
operator.
 * 4
The
-a
and
-o
operators are left associative.
 * 4
The parentheses can be used to alter the normal precedence and
associativity.

The BSD and System V versions of
-f
are not the same. The BSD definition was:
-f file 10
True if
file
exists and is not a directory.

The SVID version (true if the file exists and is a regular file) was
chosen for this volume of POSIX.1-2008 because its use is consistent with the
-b ,
-c ,
-d ,
and
-p
operands (c
file
exists and is a specific file type).

The
-e
primary, possessing similar functionality to that provided by the C
shell, was added because it provides the only way for a shell script to
find out if a file exists without trying to open the file. Since
implementations are allowed to add additional file types, a portable
script cannot use:
test -b foo -o -c foo -o -d foo -o -f foo -o -p foo
to find out if
foo
is an existing file. On historical BSD systems, the existence of a
file could be determined by:
test -f foo -o -d foo
but there was no easy way to determine that an existing file was a
regular file. An early proposal used the KornShell
-a
primary (with the same meaning), but this was changed to
-e
because there were concerns about the high probability of humans
confusing the
-a
primary with the
-a
binary operator.

The following options were not included in this volume of POSIX.1-2008, although they are
provided by some implementations. These operands should not be used by
new implementations for other purposes:
-k file 10
True if
file
exists and its sticky bit is set.
-C file 10
True if
file
is a contiguous file.
-V file 10
True if
file
is a version file.

The following option was not included because it was undocumented in
most implementations, has been removed from some implementations
(including System V), and the functionality is provided by the shell
(see
Section 2.6.2 ,  Parameter Expansion.
-l string 10
The length of the string
string .

The
-b ,
-c ,
-g ,
-p ,
-u ,
and
-x
operands are derived from the SVID; historical BSD does not provide
them. The
-k
operand is derived from System V; historical BSD does not provide it.

On historical BSD systems,
test
-w
directory
always returned false because
test
tried to open the directory for writing, which always fails.

Some additional primaries newly invented or from the KornShell appeared
in an early proposal as part of the conditional command (c
[[]] ):
s1
>
s2 ,
s1
<
s2 ,
str
=
pattern ,
str
!=
pattern ,
f1
-nt
f2 ,
f1
-ot
f2 ,
and
f1
-ef
f2 .
They were not carried forward into the
test
utility when the conditional command was removed from the shell because
they have not been included in the
test
utility built into historical implementations of the
sh
utility.

The
-t
file_descriptor
primary is shown with a mandatory argument because the grammar is
ambiguous if it can be omitted. Historical implementations have allowed
it to be omitted, providing a default of 1.

It is noted that
'[' 
is not part of the portable filename character set; however, since it
is required to be encoded by a single byte, and is part of the portable
character set, the name of this utility forms a character string across
all supported locales.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
