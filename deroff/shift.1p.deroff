NAME
shift
-- shift positional parameters
SYNOPSIS
shift [n]

DESCRIPTION
The positional parameters shall be shifted. Positional parameter 1
shall be assigned the value of parameter (1+n), parameter 2 shall
be assigned the value of parameter (2+n), and so on. The
parameters represented by the numbers
"$#" 
down to
"$#-n+1" 
shall be unset, and the parameter
'#' 
is updated to reflect the new number of positional parameters.

The value
n
shall be an unsigned decimal integer less than or equal to the value of
the special parameter
'#' .
If
n
is not given, it shall be assumed to be 1. If
n
is 0, the positional and special parameters are not changed.
