NAME
psl - Explore the Public Suffix List
SYNOPSIS
psl
[,options/] ,<domains/...,>/
DESCRIPTION
`psl' explores the Public Suffix List.  It takes a list of domains on
the command line, or if no domains are present on the command line, it
reads one domain per line from standard input.  It prints its results
to standard output, with each line containing one domain followed by a
colon, followed by the relevant information for that domain.
MODES
The information printed per domain changes based on the selected mode.

Available modes are:

--is-public-suffix
check if domains are public suffixes. [default]

Returned data: 1 if the domain is a public suffix, 0 otherwise.

This option can be combined with --no-star-rule.  It's use will
switch off the PSL 'prevailing star rule' so that all TLDs not
explicitly listed in the PSL will return 0 (not a public suffix).

--is-cookie-domain-acceptable <cookie-domain>
check if cookie-domain is acceptable for domains.

Returned data: 1 if cookie-domain is acceptable for the
domain, 0 otherwise.

--print-unreg-domain
Returned data: the longest public suffix part for each domain.

--print-reg-domain
Returned data: the shortest private suffix part for each domain.
VERSION INFORMATION
`psl' can instead be used to report information about the version of
the library and its built-in Public Suffix data:

--version
show library version information

--print-info
print info about library builtin data
PUBLIC SUFFIX DATA
By default, `psl' will use the latest available Public Suffix data.

You can also direct it to use a different file:

--use-latest-data
use the latest available PSL data [default]

--use-builtin-data
use the builtin PSL data

--load-psl-file <filename>
load PSL data from file
