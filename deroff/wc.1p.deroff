The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult

or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
wc
-- word, line, and byte or character count
SYNOPSIS
wc [-c|-m] [-lw] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
The
wc
utility shall read one or more input files and, by default, write the
number of
<newline>
characters, words, and bytes contained in each input file to the standard
output.

The utility also shall write a total count for all named files, if more
than one input file is specified.

The
wc
utility shall consider a
word
to be a non-zero-length string of characters delimited by white space.
OPTIONS
The
wc
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-c 10
Write to the standard output the number of bytes in each input file.
-l 10
Write to the standard output the number of
<newline>
characters in each input file.
-m 10
Write to the standard output the number of characters in each input
file.
-w 10
Write to the standard output the number of words in each input file.

When any option is specified,
wc
shall report only the information requested by the specified options.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
file 10
A pathname of an input file. If no
file
operands are specified, the standard input shall be used.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used if no
file
operands are specified, and shall be used if a
file
operand is
'-' 
and the implementation treats the
'-' 
as meaning standard input.
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
See the INPUT FILES section.
INPUT FILES
The input files may be of any type.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
wc :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and which
characters are defined as white-space characters.
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and
informative messages written to standard output.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
By default, the standard output shall contain an entry for each input
file of the form:
"%d %d %d %s\n", <newlines>, <words>, <bytes>, <file>
If the
-m
option is specified, the number of characters shall replace the
<bytes> field in this format.

If any options are specified and the
-l
option is not specified, the number of
<newline>
characters shall not be written.

If any options are specified and the
-w
option is not specified, the number of words shall not be written.

If any options are specified and neither
-c
nor
-m
is specified, the number of bytes or characters shall not be written.

If no input
file
operands are specified, no name shall be written and no
<blank>
characters preceding the pathname shall be written.

If more than one input
file
operand is specified, an additional line shall be written, of the same
format as the other lines, except that the word
total
(in the POSIX locale) shall be written instead of a pathname and the
total of each column shall be written as appropriate. Such an
additional line, if any, is written at the end of the output.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
The
-m
option is not a switch, but an option at the same level as
-c .
Thus, to produce the full default output with character counts instead
of bytes, the command required is:
wc -mlw
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The output file format pseudo-c
printf()
string differs from the System V version of
wc :
"%7d%7d%7d %s\n"
which produces possibly ambiguous and unparsable results for very large
files, as it assumes no number shall exceed six digits.

Some historical implementations use only
<space>,
<tab>,
and
<newline>
as word separators. The equivalent of the ISO C standard
isspace()
function is more appropriate.

The
-c
option stands for ``character'' count, even though it counts bytes.
This stems from the sometimes erroneous historical view that bytes and
characters are the same size. Due to international requirements, the
-m
option (reminiscent of ``multi-byte'') was added to obtain actual
character counts.

Early proposals only specified the results when input files were text
files. The current specification more closely matches historical
practice. (Bytes, words, and
<newline>
characters are counted separately and the results are written when an
end-of-file is detected.)

Historical implementations of the
wc
utility only accepted one argument to specify the options
-c ,
-l ,
and
-w .
Some of them also had multiple occurrences of an option cause the
corresponding count to be written multiple times and had the order of
specification of the options affect the order of the fields on output,
but did not document either of these. Because common usage either
specifies no options or only one option, and because none of this was
documented, the changes required by this volume of POSIX.1-2008 should not break many
historical applications (and do not break any historical conforming
applications).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
