NAME
systemd-remount-fs.service, systemd-remount-fs - Remount root and kernel file systems
SYNOPSIS

systemd-remount-fs.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-remount-fs
DESCRIPTION

systemd-remount-fs.service
is an early boot service that applies mount options listed in
fstab(5)
to the root file system, the
/usr
file system, and the kernel API file systems. This is required so that the mount options of these file systems -- which are pre-mounted by the kernel, the initial RAM disk, container environments or system manager code -- are updated to those listed in
/etc/fstab. This service ignores normal file systems and only changes the root file system (i.e.
/),
/usr
and the virtual kernel API file systems such as
/proc,
/sys
or
/dev. This service executes no operation if
/etc/fstab
does not exist or lists no entries for the mentioned file systems.

For a longer discussion of kernel API file systems see
