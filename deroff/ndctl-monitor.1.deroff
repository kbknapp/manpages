NAME
ndctl-monitor - Monitor the smart events of nvdimm objects
SYNOPSIS
ndctl monitor [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

Ndctl monitor is used for monitoring the smart events of nvdimm
objects and dumping the json format notifications to syslog, standard
output or a logfile.

The objects to monitor and smart events to notify can be selected by
setting options and/or the configuration file at
/etc/ndctl/monitor.conf

Both, the values in configuration file and in options will work. If
there is a conflict, the values in options will override the values in
the configuration file. Any updated values in the configuration file will
take effect only after the monitor process is restarted.
EXAMPLES

Run a monitor as a daemon to monitor DIMMs on bus "nfit_test.1"
ndctl monitor --bus=nfit_test.1 --daemon
Run a monitor as a one-shot command and output the notifications to
/var/log/ndctl.log
ndctl monitor --log=/var/log/ndctl.log
Run a monitor daemon as a system service
systemctl start ndctl-monitor.service
OPTIONS

-b, --bus=

Enforce that the operation only be carried on devices that are
attached to the given bus. Where bus can be a provider name
or a bus id number.
-d, --dimm=

A nmemX device name, or dimm id number. Select the devices to
monitor reference the given dimm.
-r, --region=

A regionX device name, or a region id number. The keyword all
can be specified to carry out the operation on every region in
the system, optionally filtered by bus id (see --bus= option).
-n, --namespace=

A namespaceX.Y device name, or namespace region plus id tuple
X.Y.
-l, --log=

Send log messages to the specified destination.
oc
"<file>":
Send log messages to specified <file>. When fopen() is not able
to open <file>, log messages will be forwarded to syslog.
oc
"syslog":
Send messages to syslog.
oc
"standard":
Send messages to standard output.
The default log destination is syslog if "--daemon" is specified,
otherwise standard. Note that standard and relative path for <file>
will not work if "--daemon" is specified.

-c, --config-file=

Provide the config file to use. This overrides the default config
typically found in /etc/ndctl
--daemon

Run a monitor as a daemon.
-D, --dimm-event=

Name of an smart health event from the following:
oc
"dimm-spares-remaining": Spare Blocks Remaining value has gone
below the pre-programmed threshold.
oc
"dimm-media-temperature": NVDIMM Media temperature value has
gone above the pre-programmed threshold.
oc
"dimm-controller-temperature": NVDIMM Controller temperature
value has gone above the pre-programmed threshold.
oc
"dimm-health-state": NVDIMM Normal Health Status has changed
oc
"dimm-unclean-shutdown": NVDIMM Last Shutdown Status was a
unclean shutdown.
The monitor will attempt to enable the alarm control bits for all
specified events.

-u, --human
