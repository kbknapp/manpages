NAME
ndctl-sanitize-dimm - Perform a cryptographic destruction or overwrite of the contents of the given NVDIMM(s)
SYNOPSIS
ndctl sanitize-dimm <nmem0> [<nmem1>..<nmemN>] [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

The sanitize-dimm command performs a cryptographic destruction of the
contents of the given NVDIMM. It scrambles the data, and any metadata or
info-blocks, but it doesn't modify namespace labels. Therefore, any
namespaces on regions associated with the given NVDIMM will be retained,
but they will end up in the raw mode.

Additionally, after completion of this command, the security and passphrase
for the given NVDIMM will be disabled, and the passphrase and any key material
will also be removed from the keyring and the ndctl keys directory at
/etc/ndctl/keys

The command supports two different methods of performing the cryptographic
erase. The default is crypto-erase, but additionally, an overwrite option
is available which overwrites not only the data area, but also the label area,
thus losing record of any namespaces the given NVDIMM participates in.
OPTIONS

<dimm>
A 'nmemX' device name, or a dimm id number. The keyword 'all' can
be specified to carry out the operation on every dimm in the system,
optionally filtered by bus id (see --bus= option).
-b, --bus=

Enforce that the operation only be carried on devices that are
attached to the given bus. Where bus can be a provider name or a bus
id number.
-c, --crypto-erase

Replace the media encryption key on the NVDIMM causing all existing
data to read as cipher text with the new key. This does not change
label data. Namespaces get reverted to raw mode.
-o, --ovewrite

Wipe the entire DIMM, including label data. This can take significant
time, and the command is non-blocking. With this option, the overwrite
request is merely submitted to the NVDIMM, and the completion is
asynchronous.
-m, --master_passphrase

Indicate that we are using the master passphrase to perform the erase.
This only is applicable to the crypto-erase option.
--verbose

Emit debug messages.

THEORY OF OPERATION

The Intel Device Specific Methods (DSM) specification v1.7 and v1.8 [1]
introduced the following security management operations:
enable passhprase, update passphrase, unlock DIMM, disable security,
freeze security, secure (crypto) erase, overwrite, master passphrase
enable, master passphrase update, and master passphrase secure erase.

The security management for NVDIMMs is comprised of two parts. The front end
uses the Linux key management framework (trusted and encrypted keys [2]) to
store the encrypted passphrases in the kernel-managed keyring. The interface
for this is the keyutils utility which uses the key management APIs in the
Linux kernel. The back end takes the decrypted payload (which is the DIMM
passphrase) and passes it to the DIMM.

Unlike other DSMs which are composed by libndctl and sent to the kernel via
an ioctl, the security DSMs are managed through the security sysfs attribute
under the dimm device. A key-ID is written to the security attribute and
the kernel pulls the associated key material from the user keyring that is
maintained by the kernel.

The security process begins with the generation of a master key that is
used to seal (encrypt) the passphrase for the DIMM. There can either be one
common master key that is used to encrypt every DIMM's passphrase, or a
separate key can be generated for each DIMM. The master key is also referred
to as the key-encryption-key (kek). The kek can either be generated by the
TPM (Trusted Platform Module) on the system, or alternatively, the System
Master Key can also be used as the kek

For testing purposes a user key with randomized payload can also be used as
a kek. See [2] for details. To perform any security operations, it is
expected that the kek has been added to the kernel's user keyring as shown
in example below:
# keyctl show
Session Keyring
 736023423 --alswrv      0     0  keyring: _ses
 675104189 --alswrv      0 65534   \_ keyring: _uid.0
 680187394 --alswrv      0     0       \_ trusted: nvdimm-master
Before performing any of the security operations, all the regions associated
with the DIMM in question need to be disabled. For the overwrite operation,
in addition to the regions, the dimm also needs to be disabled.

The following sub-sections describe specifics of each security feature.
UNLOCK

Unlock is performed by the kernel, however a preparation step must happen
before the unlock DSM can be issued by the kernel. It is expected that
from the initramfs, a setup command (ndctl load-keys) is executed before
the libnvdimm module is loaded by modprobe. This command will inject the
kek and the encrypted passphrases into the kernel's user keyring. During
the probe of the libnvdimm driver, it will:
 1.c
Check the security state of the device and see if the DIMM is locked
 2.c
Request the associated encrypted passphrase from the kernel's user key ring
 3.c
Use the kek to decrypt the passphrase
 4.c
Create the unlock DSM, copy the decrypted payload into the DSM
 5.c
Issue the DSM to unlock the DIMM
If the DIMM is already unlocked, the kernel will attempt to revalidate the
passphrase. If we fail to revalidate the passphrase, the kernel will freeze
the security and disallow any further security configuration changes. A kernel
module parameter is available to override this behavior.
SETUP USER PASSPHRASE

To setup the passphrase for a DIMM, it is expected that the kek to be used
is present in the kernel's user keyring. The kek encrypts the DIMM passphrase
using the enc32 key format. The plaintext passphrase is never provided by
or made visible to the user. It is instead randomly generated by the kernel and
userspace does not have access to it. Upon encryption, a binary blob of the
passphrase is written to the passphrase blob storage directory (/etc/ndctl/keys).
The user is responsible for backing up the passphrase blobs to a secure location.
UPDATE USER PASSPHRASE

The update user passphrase operation uses the same DSM command as enable user
passphrase. Most of the work is done on the key management side. The user has
the option of providing a new kek for the new passphrase, but continuing to
use the existing kek is also acceptable.
The following operations are performed for update-passphrase:
 1.c
Remove the enrypted passphrase from the kernel's user keyring.
 2.c
Rename the passphrase blob to old.
 3.c
Load this old passphrase blob into the keyring with an "old" name.
 4.c
Create the new passphrase and encrypt with the  kek.
 5.c
Send DSM with the old and new decrypted passphrases.
 6.c
Remove old passphrase and the passphrase blob from the keyring.

REMOVE USER PASSPHRASE

The key-ID for the passphrase to be removed is written to sysfs. The kernel
then sends the DSM to disable security, and the passphrase is then removed
from the keyring, and the associated passphrase blob is deleted.
CRYPTO (SECURE) ERASE

This operation is similar to disable-passphrase. The kernel issues a WBINVD
instruction before and after the operation to ensure no data corruption from
a stale CPU cache. Use ndctl's sanitize-dimm command with the --crypto-erase
option to perform this operation.
OVERWRITE

This is invoked using --overwrite option for ndctl sanitize-dimm.
The overwrite operation wipes the entire NVDIMM. The operation can take a
significant amount of time. NOTE: When the command returns successfully,
it just means overwrite has been successfully started, and not that the
overwrite is complete. Subsequently, 'ndctl wait-overwrite'can be used
to wait for the NVDIMMs that are performing overwrite. Upon successful
completion of an overwrite, the WBINVD instruction is issued by the kernel.
If both --crypto-erase and --overwrite options are supplied, then
crypto-erase is performed before overwrite.
SECURITY FREEZE

This operation does not require a passphrase. This will cause any security
command other than a status query to be locked out until the next boot.
MASTER PASSPHRASE SETUP, UPDATE, and CRYPTO ERASE

These operations are similar to the user passphrase enable and update. The only
difference is that a different passphrase is used. The master passphrase has no
relation to the master key (kek) which is used for encryption of either
passphrase.
