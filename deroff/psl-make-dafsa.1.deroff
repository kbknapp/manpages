NAME
psl-make-dafsa - generate a compact and optimized DAFSA from a Public Suffix List 
SYNOPSIS
psl-make-dafsa
[,options/] infile outfile
DESCRIPTION
psl-make-dafsa produces C/C++ code or an
architecture-independent binary object that represents a Deterministic
Acyclic Finite State Automaton (DAFSA) from a textual representation
of a Public Suffix List.  Input and output files must be specified on
the command line.

This compact representation enables optimized queries of the list,
saving both time and space when compared to searches of human-readable
representations.
OPTIONS
The format of the data read and written by psl-make-dafsa
depends on options passed to it.
--output-format=[cxx|cxx+|binary]
cxx: (default) output is C/C++ code

cxx+: output is C/C++ code plus statistical assignments (used by libpsl build process)

binary: output is an architecture-independent binary format

--encoding=[utf-8|ascii]
utf-8: (default) UTF-8 mode (output contains UTF-8 + punycode)

ascii: (deprecated) 7-bit ASCII mode (output contains punycode only)
