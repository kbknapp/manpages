NAME
ndctl-disable-region - disable the given region(s) and all descendant namespaces
SYNOPSIS
ndctl disable-region <region> [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

A generic REGION device is registered for each PMEM range or
BLK-aperture set.  LIBNVDIMM provides a built-in driver for these REGION
devices.  This driver is responsible for reconciling the aliased DPA
mappings across all regions, parsing the LABEL, if present, and then
emitting NAMESPACE devices with the resolved/exclusive DPA-boundaries
for the nd_pmem or nd_blk device driver to consume.
OPTIONS

<region>
A 'regionX' device name, or a region id number. The keyword 'all' can
be specified to carry out the operation on every region in the system,
optionally filtered by bus id (see --bus= option).
-b, --bus=

Enforce that the operation only be carried on devices that are
attached to the given bus. Where bus can be a provider name or a bus
id number.
