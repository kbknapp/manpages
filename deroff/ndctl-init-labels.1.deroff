NAME
ndctl-init-labels - initialize the label data area on a dimm or set of dimms
SYNOPSIS
ndctl init-labels <nmem0> [<nmem1>..<nmemN>] [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

The namespace label area is a small persistent partition of capacity
available on some NVDIMM devices.  The label area is used to resolve
aliasing between pmem and blk capacity by delineating namespace
boundaries.
By default, and in kernels prior to v4.10, the kernel only honors labels
when a DIMM aliases PMEM and BLK capacity. Starting with v4.10 the
kernel will honor labels for sub-dividing PMEM if all the DIMMs in an
interleave set / region have a valid namespace index block.

This command can be used to initialize the namespace index block if it
is missing or reinitialize it if it is damaged.  Note that
reinitialization effectively destroys all existing namespace labels on
the DIMM.
EXAMPLE

Find the DIMMs that comprise a given region:
# ndctl list -RD --region=region1
{
  "dimms":[
    {
      "dev":"nmem0",
      "id":"8680-56341200"
    }
  ],
  "regions":[
    {
      "dev":"region1",
      "size":268435456,
      "available_size":0,
      "type":"pmem",
      "mappings":[
        {
          "dimm":"nmem0",
          "offset":13958643712,
          "length":268435456
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Disable that region so the DIMM label area can be written from
userspace:
# ndctl disable-region region1
Initialize labels:
# ndctl init-labels nmem0
Re-enable the region:
# ndctl enable-region region1
Create a namespace in that region:
# ndctl create-namespace --region=region1
OPTIONS

<memory device(s)>

One or more nmemX device names. The keyword all can be specified to
operate on every dimm in the system, optionally filtered by bus id (see
--bus= option).
-b, --bus=

Limit operation to memory devices (dimms) that are on the given bus.
Where bus can be a provider name or a bus id number.
-v

Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if ndctl was built with
logging and debug enabled).
-f, --force

Force initialization of the label space even if there appears to
be an existing / valid namespace index.  Warning, this will
destroy all defined namespaces on the dimm.
-V, --label-version

Initialize with a specific version of labels from the namespace
label specification. Defaults to 1.1
