NAME
ndctl-read-labels - read out the label area on a dimm or set of dimms
SYNOPSIS
ndctl read-labels <nmem0> [<nmem1>..<nmemN>] [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

The namespace label area is a small persistent partition of capacity
available on some NVDIMM devices.  The label area is used to resolve
aliasing between pmem and blk capacity by delineating namespace
boundaries.
This command dumps the raw binary data in a dimm's label area to stdout or a
file.  In the multi-dimm case the data is concatenated.
OPTIONS

<memory device(s)>

One or more nmemX device names. The keyword all can be specified to
operate on every dimm in the system, optionally filtered by bus id (see
--bus= option).
-b, --bus=

Limit operation to memory devices (dimms) that are on the given bus.
Where bus can be a provider name or a bus id number.
-v

Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if ndctl was built with
logging and debug enabled).
-o, --output

output file
-j, --json

parse the label data into json assuming the NVDIMM Namespace
Specification format.
