NAME
FSG - manual page for FSG lsb_release v1.4
SYNOPSIS
lsb_release
[OPTION]...
DESCRIPTION
FSG lsb_release v1.4 prints certain LSB (Linux Standard Base) and
Distribution information.

With no OPTION specified it is the same as -v.
OPTIONS

-v, --version
Display the version of the LSB specification against which the distribution is compliant.

-i, --id
Display the string id of the distributor.

-d, --description
Display the single line text description of the distribution.

-r, --release
Display the release number of the distribution.

-c, --codename
Display the codename according to the distribution release.

-a, --all
Display all of the above information.

-s, --short
Display all of the above information in short output format.

-h, --help
Display this message.
FILES

If the installation is LSB compliant, the "/etc/lsb-release"
file should contain the LSB_VERSION field. The value of the
field should be the version number of the LSB specification against
which the installation is compliant. If the installation is not
compliant, the above field should 
not
be present.

Optional fields are DISTRIB_ID, DISTRIB_RELEASE,
DISTRIB_CODENAME, DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION and can be used to
overwrite information which is parsed from the next file.
 
The "/etc/[distrib]-release" file contains a description line
which is parsed to get information (especially on currently non-LSB
compliant systems).

The required line style is:

"Distributor release x.x (Codename)"

Where Distributor can be a couple of words, but then concatenated (i.e. Linux Foo BarLinux Linux -> FooBarLinux),

x.x starts with a digit followed by any non-blank characters,
Codename will also be concatenated (blanks cleanup only).

And release is a keyword not to be used in DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION if you don't want to overwrite "/etc/[distrib]-release" data.

Notice: To support the Debian distributions' lack of information (see "/etc/debian_version" file) some have been directly added into the lsb_release script.
EXAMPLES
The /etc/lsb-release file contains:

LSB_VERSION="1.0"

DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="I enjoy using my distrib"

And the /etc/foobar-release file contains:

My Linux Distrib release 1.0RC4 (TryIt)

$ ./lsb_release --all

LSB Version:    1.0

Distributor ID: MyDistrib

Description:    I enjoy using my distrib

Release:        1.0RC4

Codename:       TryIt

$ ./lsb_release -a -s

1.0 MyDistrib "I enjoy using my distrib" 1.0RC4 TryIt

Then simply without the "/etc/lsb-release" file, that means result on a non-LSB compliant distrib:

$ ./lsb_release -a

LSB Version:    n/a

Distributor ID: MyDistrib

Description:    My Linux Distrib release 1.0RC4 (TryIt)

Release:        1.0RC4

Codename:       TryIt
