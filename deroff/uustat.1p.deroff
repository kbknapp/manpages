NAME
uustat
-- uucp status enquiry and job control
SYNOPSIS
uustat [-q|-k jobid|-r jobid]

uustat [-s system] [-u user]

DESCRIPTION
The
uustat
utility shall display the status of, or cancel, previously specified
uucp
requests, or provide general status on
uucp
connections to other systems.

When no options are given,
uustat
shall write to standard output the status of all
uucp
requests issued by the current user.

Typical implementations of this utility require a communications line
configured to use the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Chapter 11 ,  General Terminal Interface,
but other communications means may be used. On systems where there are
no available communications means (either temporarily or permanently),
this utility shall write an error message describing the problem and
exit with a non-zero exit status.
OPTIONS
The
uustat
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-q 10
Write the jobs queued for each machine.
-k jobid 10
Kill the
uucp
request whose job identification is
jobid .
The application shall ensure that the killed
uucp
request belongs to the person invoking
uustat
unless that user has appropriate privileges.
-r jobid 10
Rejuvenate
jobid .
The files associated with
jobid
are touched so that their modification time is set to the current
time. This prevents the cleanup program from deleting the job until
the jobs modification time reaches the limit imposed by the program.
-s system 10
Write the status of all
uucp
requests for remote system
system .
-u user 10
Write the status of all
uucp
requests issued by
user .
OPERANDS
None.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
uustat :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error, and
informative messages written to standard output.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The standard output shall consist of information about each job
selected, in an unspecified format. The information shall include at
least the job ID, the user ID or name, and the remote system name.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
This utility is part of the UUCP Utilities option and need not be
supported by all implementations.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
None.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
