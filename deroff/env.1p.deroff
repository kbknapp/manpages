NAME
env
-- set the environment for command invocation
SYNOPSIS
env [-i] [name=value]... [utility [argument...]]

DESCRIPTION
The
env
utility shall obtain the current environment, modify it according to
its arguments, then invoke the utility named by the
utility
operand with the modified environment.

Optional arguments shall be passed to
utility .

If no
utility
operand is specified, the resulting environment shall be written to the
standard output, with one
name =c
value
pair per line.

If the first argument is
'-' ,
the results are unspecified.
OPTIONS
The
env
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines,
except for the unspecified usage of
'-' .

The following options shall be supported:
-i 10
Invoke
utility
with exactly the environment specified by the arguments; the inherited
environment shall be ignored completely.
OPERANDS
The following operands shall be supported:
name=value 10
Arguments of the form
name =c
value
shall modify the execution environment, and shall be placed into the
inherited environment before the
utility
is invoked.
utility 10
The name of the utility to be invoked. If the
utility
operand names any of the special built-in utilities in
Section 2.14 ,  Special Built-In Utilities,
the results are undefined.
argument 10
A string to pass as an argument for the invoked utility.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
env :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
PATH 10
Determine the location of the
utility ,
as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Chapter 8 ,  Environment Variables.
If
PATH
is specified as a
name =c
value
operand to
env ,
the
value
given shall be used in the search for
utility .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
If no
utility
operand is specified, each
name =c
value
pair in the resulting environment shall be written in the form:
"%s=%s\n", <name>, <value>
If the
utility
operand is specified, the
env
utility shall not write to standard output.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
If
utility
is invoked, the exit status of
env
shall be the exit status of
utility ;
otherwise, the
env
utility shall exit with one of the following values:
    0 8
The
env
utility completed successfully.
1-125 8
An error occurred in the
env
utility.
  126 8
The utility specified by
utility
was found but could not be invoked.
  127 8
The utility specified by
utility
could not be found.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
The
command ,
env ,
nice ,
nohup ,
time ,
and
xargs
utilities have been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs
so that applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from
``invoked utility exited with an error indication''. The value 127 was
chosen because it is not commonly used for other meanings; most
utilities use small values for ``normal error conditions'' and the
values above 128 can be confused with termination due to receipt of a
signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate that
the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts produce
meaningful error messages differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The
distinction between exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell
practice that uses 127 when all attempts to
exec
the utility fail with
[ENOENT] ,
and uses 126 when any attempt to
exec
the utility fails for any other reason.

Historical implementations of the
env
utility use the
execvp()
or
execlp()
functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2008 to invoke the specified utility; this
provides better performance and keeps users from having to escape
characters with special meaning to the shell. Therefore, shell
functions, special built-ins, and built-ins that are only provided by
the shell are not found.
EXAMPLES
The following command:
env -i PATH=/mybin:"$PATH" $(getconf V7_ENV) mygrep xyz myfile
invokes the command
mygrep
with a new
PATH
value as the only entry in its environment other than any variables
required by the implementation for conformance. In this case,
PATH
is used to locate
mygrep ,
which is expected to reside in
/mybin .
RATIONALE
As with all other utilities that invoke other utilities, this volume of POSIX.1-2008 only
specifies what
env
does with standard input, standard output, standard error, input files,
and output files. If a utility is executed, it is not constrained by
the specification of input and output by
env .

The
-i
option was added to allow the functionality of the removed
-
option in a manner compatible with the Utility Syntax Guidelines. It
is possible to create a non-conforming environment using the
-i
option, as it may remove environment variables required by the
implementation for conformance. The following will preserve these
environment variables as well as preserve the
PATH
for conforming utilities:
IFS='
'
# The preceding value should be <space><tab><newline>.
# Set IFS to its default value.

set -f
# disable pathname expansion

\unalias -a
# Unset all possible aliases.
# Note that unalias is escaped to prevent an alias
# being used for unalias.
# This step is not strictly necessary, since aliases are not inherited,
# and the ENV environment variable is only used by interactive shells,
# the only way any aliases can exist in a script is if it defines them
# itself.

unset -f env getconf
# Ensure env and getconf are not user functions.

env -i $(getconf V7_ENV) PATH="$(getconf PATH)" command
Some have suggested that
env
is redundant since the same effect is achieved by:
name=value ... utility [ argument ... ]
The example is equivalent to
env
when an environment variable is being added to the environment of the
command, but not when the environment is being set to the given value.
The
env
utility also writes out the current environment if invoked without
arguments. There is sufficient functionality beyond what the example
provides to justify inclusion of
env .
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
