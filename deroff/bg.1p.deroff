NAME
bg
-- run jobs in the background
SYNOPSIS
bg [job_id...]

DESCRIPTION
If job control is enabled (see the description of
set
-m ),
the
bg
utility shall resume suspended jobs from the current environment (see
Section 2.12 ,  Shell Execution Environment)
by running them as background jobs. If the job specified by
job_id
is already a running background job, the
bg
utility shall have no effect and shall exit successfully.

Using
bg
to place a job into the background shall cause its process ID to become
``known in the current shell execution environment'', as if it had been
started as an asynchronous list; see
Section 2.9.3.1 ,  Examples.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
job_id 10
Specify the job to be resumed as a background job. If no
job_id
operand is given, the most recently suspended job shall be used. The
format of
job_id
is described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 3.204 ,  Job Control Job ID.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
bg :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The output of
bg
shall consist of a line in the format:
"[%d] %s\n", <job-number>, <command>
where the fields are as follows:
<job-number> 10
A number that can be used to identify the job to the
wait ,
fg ,
and
kill
utilities. Using these utilities, the job can be identified by
prefixing the job number with
'%' .
<command> 10
The associated command that was given to the shell.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
If job control is disabled, the
bg
utility shall exit with an error and no job shall be placed in the
background.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
A job is generally suspended by typing the SUSP character
(<control>-Z on most systems); see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Chapter 11 ,  General Terminal Interface.
At that point,
bg
can put the job into the background. This is most effective when the
job is expecting no terminal input and its output has been redirected
to non-terminal files. A background job can be forced to stop when it
has terminal output by issuing the command:
stty tostop
A background job can be stopped with the command:
kill -s stop job ID
The
bg
utility does not work as expected when it is operating in its own
utility execution environment because that environment has no suspended
jobs. In the following examples:
... | xargs bg
(bg)
each
bg
operates in a different environment and does not share its parent
shell's understanding of jobs. For this reason,
bg
is generally implemented as a shell regular built-in.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The extensions to the shell specified in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 have mostly been based
on features provided by the KornShell. The job control features
provided by
bg ,
fg ,
and
jobs
are also based on the KornShell. The standard developers examined the
characteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities and found
that differences exist. Despite widespread use of the C shell, the
KornShell versions were selected for this volume of POSIX.1-2008 to maintain a degree of
uniformity with the rest of the KornShell features selected (such as
the very popular command line editing features).

The
bg
utility is expected to wrap its output if the output exceeds the number
of display columns.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
