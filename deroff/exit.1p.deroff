NAME
exit
-- cause the shell to exit
SYNOPSIS
exit [n]

DESCRIPTION
The
exit
utility shall cause the shell to exit with the exit status specified
by the unsigned decimal integer
n .
If
n
is specified, but its value is not between 0 and 255 inclusively, the
exit status is undefined.

A
trap
on
EXIT
shall be executed before the shell terminates, except when the
exit
utility is invoked in that
trap
itself, in which case the shell shall exit immediately.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
See the DESCRIPTION.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
None.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
Not used.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The exit status shall be
n ,
if specified. Otherwise, the value shall be the exit value of the last
command executed, or zero if no command was executed. When
exit
is executed in a
trap
action, the last command is considered to be the command that executed
immediately preceding the
trap
action.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
Exit with a
true
value:
exit 0
Exit with a
false
value:
exit 1
RATIONALE
As explained in other sections, certain exit status values have been
reserved for special uses and should be used by applications only for
those purposes:
 126 8
A file to be executed was found, but it was not an executable utility.

A utility to be executed was not found.
>128 8
A command was interrupted by a signal.
