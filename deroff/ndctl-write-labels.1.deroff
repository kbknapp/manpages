NAME
ndctl-write-labels - write data to the label area on a dimm
SYNOPSIS
ndctl write-labels <nmem> [-i <filename>]
DESCRIPTION

The namespace label area is a small persistent partition of capacity
available on some NVDIMM devices.  The label area is used to resolve
aliasing between pmem and blk capacity by delineating namespace
boundaries.
Read data from the input filename, or stdin, and write it to the given
<nmem> device. Note that the device must not be active in any region,
otherwise the kernel will not allow write access to the device's label
data area.
OPTIONS

<memory device(s)>

One or more nmemX device names. The keyword all can be specified to
operate on every dimm in the system, optionally filtered by bus id (see
--bus= option).
-b, --bus=

Limit operation to memory devices (dimms) that are on the given bus.
Where bus can be a provider name or a bus id number.
-v

Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if ndctl was built with
logging and debug enabled).
-i, --input

input file
