NAME
qhold
-- hold batch jobs
SYNOPSIS
qhold [-h hold_list] job_identifier...

DESCRIPTION
A hold is placed on a batch job by a request to the batch server that
manages the batch job. A batch job that has one or more holds is not
eligible for execution. The
qhold
utility is a user-accessible client of batch services that requests one
or more types of hold to be placed on one or more batch jobs.

The
qhold
utility shall place holds on those batch jobs for which a batch
job_identifier
is presented to the utility.

The
qhold
utility shall place holds on batch jobs in the order in which their
batch
job_identifier s
are presented to the utility. If the
qhold
utility fails to process any batch
job_identifier
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining batch
job_identifier s,
if any.

The
qhold
utility shall place holds on each batch job by sending a
Hold Job Request
to the batch server that manages the batch job.

The
qhold
utility shall not exit until holds have been placed on the batch job
corresponding to each successfully processed batch
job_identifier .
OPTIONS
The
qhold
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following option shall be supported by the implementation:
-h hold_list 10
Define the types of holds to be placed on the batch job.
The
qhold
-h
option shall accept a value for the
hold_list
option-argument that is a string of alphanumeric characters in the
portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 6.1 ,  Portable Character Set).

The
qhold
utility shall accept a value for the
hold_list
option-argument that is a string of one or more of the characters
'u' ,
's' ,
or
'o' ,
or the single character
'n' .

For each unique character in the
hold_list
option-argument, the
qhold
utility shall add a value to the
Hold_Types
attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different
hold type:
u 6
USER
s 6
SYSTEM
o 6
OPERATOR

If any of these characters are duplicated in the
hold_list
option-argument, the duplicates shall be ignored.

An existing
Hold_Types
attribute can be cleared by the following hold type:
n 6
NO_HOLD

The
qhold
utility shall consider it an error if any hold type other than
'n' 
is combined with hold type
'n' .

Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters
'u' ,
's' ,
'o' ,
or
'n' 
within the
hold_list
option-argument. The
qhold
utility shall permit the repetition of characters, but shall not assign
additional meaning to the repeated characters.

An implementation may define other hold types. The conformance document
for an implementation shall describe any additional hold types, how
they are specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect the
behavior of the utility.

If the
-h
option is not presented to the
qhold
utility, the implementation shall set the
Hold_Types
attribute to USER.

OPERANDS
The
qhold
utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax
for a batch
job_identifier
(see
Section 3.3.1 ,  Batch Job Identifier).
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
qhold :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
LOGNAME 10
Determine the login name of the user.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
None.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS

The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
In addition to the default behavior, the
qhold
utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates that
the batch
job_identifier
does not exist on the server. Whether or not the
qhold
utility waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to
locate the job on other servers is implementation-defined.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The
qhold
utility allows users to place a hold on one or more jobs. A hold makes
a batch job ineligible for execution.

The
qhold
utility has options that allow the user to specify the type of hold.
Should the user wish to place a hold on a set of jobs that meet a
selection criteria, such a list of jobs can be acquired using the
qselect
utility.

The
-h
option allows the user to specify the type of hold that is to be placed
on the job. This option allows for USER, SYSTEM, OPERATOR, and
implementation-defined hold types. The USER and OPERATOR holds are
distinct. The batch server that manages the batch job will verify that
the user is authorized to set the specified hold for the batch job.

Mail is not required on hold because the administrator has the tools
and libraries to build this option if he or she wishes.

Historically, the
qhold
utility has been a part of some existing batch systems, although it has
not traditionally been a part of the NQS.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The
qhold
utility may be removed in a future version.
