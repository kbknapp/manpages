The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult

or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
fg
-- run jobs in the foreground
SYNOPSIS
fg [job_id]

DESCRIPTION
If job control is enabled (see the description of
set
-m ),
the
fg
utility shall move a background job from the current environment (see
Section 2.12 ,  Shell Execution Environment)
into the foreground.

Using
fg
to place a job into the foreground shall remove its process ID from the
list of those ``known in the current shell execution environment''; see
Section 2.9.3.1 ,  Examples.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
job_id 10
Specify the job to be run as a foreground job. If no
job_id
operand is given, the
job_id
for the job that was most recently suspended, placed in the background,
or run as a background job shall be used. The format of
job_id
is described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 3.204 ,  Job Control Job ID.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
fg :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The
fg
utility shall write the command line of the job to standard output
in the following format:
"%s\n", <command>
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
If job control is disabled, the
fg
utility shall exit with an error and no job shall be placed in the
foreground.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
The
fg
utility does not work as expected when it is operating in its own
utility execution environment because that environment has no
applicable jobs to manipulate. See the APPLICATION USAGE section for
bg.
For this reason,
fg
is generally implemented as a shell regular built-in.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The extensions to the shell specified in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 have mostly been based
on features provided by the KornShell. The job control features
provided by
bg ,
fg ,
and
jobs
are also based on the KornShell. The standard developers examined the
characteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities and found
that differences exist. Despite widespread use of the C shell, the
KornShell versions were selected for this volume of POSIX.1-2008 to maintain a degree of
uniformity with the rest of the KornShell features selected (such as
the very popular command line editing features).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
