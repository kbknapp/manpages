NAME
qrerun
-- rerun batch jobs
SYNOPSIS
qrerun job_identifier...

DESCRIPTION
To rerun a batch job is to terminate the session leader of the batch
job, delete any associated checkpoint files, and return the batch job
to the batch queued state. A batch job is rerun by a request to the
batch server that manages the batch job. The
qrerun
utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests the rerunning
of one or more batch jobs.

The
qrerun
utility shall rerun those batch jobs for which a batch
job_identifier
is presented to the utility.

The
qrerun
utility shall rerun batch jobs in the order in which their batch
job_identifier s
are presented to the utility.

If the
qrerun
utility fails to process any batch
job_identifier
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining batch
job_identifier s,
if any.

The
qrerun
utility shall rerun batch jobs by sending a
Rerun Job Request
to the batch server that manages each batch job.

For each successfully processed batch
job_identifier ,
the
qrerun
utility shall have rerun the corresponding batch job at the time
the utility exits.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
The
qrerun
utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax
for a batch
job_identifier
(see
Section 3.3.1 ,  Batch Job Identifier).
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
qrerun :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
LOGNAME 10
Determine the login name of the user.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
None.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
In addition to the default behavior, the
qrerun
utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates that
the batch
job_identifier
does not exist on the server. Whether or not the
qrerun
utility waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to
locate the job on other servers is implementation-defined.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The
qrerun
utility allows users to cause jobs in the running state to exit and
rerun.

The
qrerun
utility is a new utility, vis-a-vis existing practice, that has
been defined in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 to correct user-perceived deficiencies in the
existing practice.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The
qrerun
utility may be removed in a future version.
