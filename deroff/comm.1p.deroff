This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
comm
-- select or reject lines common to two files
SYNOPSIS
comm [-123] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
The
comm
utility shall read
file1
and
file2 ,
which should be ordered in the current collating sequence, and produce
three text columns as output: lines only in
file1 ,
lines only in
file2 ,
and lines in both files.

If the lines in both files are not ordered according to the collating
sequence of the current locale, the results are unspecified.
OPTIONS
The
comm
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-1 10
Suppress the output column of lines unique to
file1 .
-2 10
Suppress the output column of lines unique to
file2 .
-3 10
Suppress the output column of lines duplicated in
file1
and
file2 .
OPERANDS
The following operands shall be supported:
file1 10
A pathname of the first file to be compared. If
file1
is
'-' ,
the standard input shall be used.
file2 10
A pathname of the second file to be compared. If
file2
is
'-' ,
the standard input shall be used.

If both
file1
and
file2
refer to standard input or to the same FIFO special, block special, or
character special file, the results are undefined.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if one of the
file1
or
file2
operands refers to standard input. See the INPUT FILES section.
INPUT FILES
The input files shall be text files.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
comm :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_COLLATE 10

Determine the locale for the collating sequence
comm
expects to have been used when the input files were sorted.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The
comm
utility shall produce output depending on the options selected. If the
-1 ,
-2 ,
and
-3
options are all selected,
comm
shall write nothing to standard output.

If the
-1
option is not selected, lines contained only in
file1
shall be written using the format:
"%s\n", <line in file1>
If the
-2
option is not selected, lines contained only in
file2
are written using the format:
"%s%s\n", <lead>, <line in file2>
where the string <lead> is as follows:
<tab> 10
The
-1
option is not selected.
null string 10
The
-1
option is selected.

If the
-3
option is not selected, lines contained in both files shall be written
using the format:
"%s%s\n", <lead>, <line in both>
where the string <lead> is as follows:
<tab><tab> 10
Neither the
-1
nor the
-2
option is selected.
<tab> 10
Exactly one of the
-1
and
-2
options is selected.
null string 10
Both the
-1
and
-2
options are selected.

If the input files were ordered according to the collating sequence of
the current locale, the lines written shall be in the collating
sequence of the original lines.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
All input files were successfully output as specified.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
If the input files are not properly presorted, the output of
comm
might not be useful.
EXAMPLES
If a file named
xcu
contains a sorted list of the utilities in this volume of POSIX.1-2008, a file named
xpg3
contains a sorted list of the utilities specified in the X/Open
Portability Guide, Issue 3, and a file named
svid89
contains a sorted list of the utilities in the System V Interface
Definition Third Edition:
comm -23 xcu xpg3 | comm -23 - svid89
would print a list of utilities in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 not specified by either of the
other documents:
comm -12 xcu xpg3 | comm -12 - svid89
would print a list of utilities specified by all three documents, and:
comm -12 xpg3 svid89 | comm -23 - xcu
would print a list of utilities specified by both XPG3 and the SVID,
but not specified in this volume of POSIX.1-2008.
RATIONALE
None.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
