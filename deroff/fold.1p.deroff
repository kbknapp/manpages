NAME
fold
-- filter for folding lines
SYNOPSIS
fold [-bs] [-w width] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
The
fold
utility is a filter that shall fold lines from its input files,
breaking the lines to have a maximum of
width
column positions (or bytes, if the
-b
option is specified). Lines shall be broken by the insertion of a
<newline>
such that each output line (referred to later in this section
as a segment) is the maximum width possible that does not exceed
the specified number of column positions (or bytes). A line shall not
be broken in the middle of a character. The behavior is undefined if
width
is less than the number of columns any single character in the input
would occupy.

If the
<carriage-return>,
<backspace>,
or
<tab>
characters are encountered in the input, and the
-b
option is not specified, they shall be treated specially:
<backspace> 10
The current count of line width shall be decremented by one, although
the count never shall become negative. The
fold
utility shall not insert a
<newline>
immediately before or after any
<backspace>,
unless the following character has a width greater than 1 and would
cause the line width to exceed
width .
<carriage-return> 10

The current count of line width shall be set to zero. The
fold
utility shall not insert a
<newline>
immediately before or after any
<carriage-return>.
<tab> 10
Each
<tab>
encountered shall advance the column position pointer to the next tab
stop. Tab stops shall be at each column position
n
such that
n
modulo 8 equals 1.
OPTIONS
The
fold
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-b 10
Count
width
in bytes rather than column positions.
-s 10
If a segment of a line contains a
<blank>
within the first
width
column positions (or bytes), break the line after the last such
<blank>
meeting the width constraints. If there is no
<blank>
meeting the requirements, the
-s
option shall have no effect for that output segment of the input line.
-w width 10
Specify the maximum line length, in column positions (or bytes if
-b
is specified). The results are unspecified if
width
is not a positive decimal number. The default value shall be 80.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
file 10
A pathname of a text file to be folded. If no
file
operands are specified, the standard input shall be used.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used if no
file
operands are specified, and shall be used if a
file
operand is
'-' 
and the implementation treats the
'-' 
as meaning standard input.
Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
See the INPUT FILES section.
INPUT FILES
If the
-b
option is specified, the input files shall be text files except that the
lines are not limited to
{LINE_MAX}
bytes in length. If the
-b
option is not specified, the input files shall be text files.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
fold :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files), and for the
determination of the width in column positions each character would
occupy on a constant-width font output device.
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The standard output shall be a file containing a sequence of characters
whose order shall be preserved from the input files, possibly with
inserted
<newline>
characters.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
All input files were processed successfully.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
The
cut
and
fold
utilities can be used to create text files out of files with arbitrary
line lengths. The
cut
utility should be used when the number of lines (or records) needs to
remain constant. The
fold
utility should be used when the contents of long lines need to be kept
contiguous.

The
fold
utility is frequently used to send text files to printers that
truncate, rather than fold, lines wider than the printer is able to
print (usually 80 or 132 column positions).
EXAMPLES
An example invocation that submits a file of possibly long lines to the
printer (under the assumption that the user knows the line width of the
printer to be assigned by
lp ):
fold -w 132 bigfile | lp
RATIONALE
Although terminal input in canonical processing mode requires the erase
character (frequently set to
<backspace>)
to erase the previous character (not byte or column position), terminal
output is not buffered and is extremely difficult, if not impossible,
to parse correctly; the interpretation depends entirely on the physical
device that actually displays/prints/stores the output. In all known
internationalized implementations, the utilities producing output for
mixed column-width output assume that a
<backspace>
character backs up one column position and outputs enough
<backspace>
characters to return to the start of the character when
<backspace>
is used to provide local line motions to support underlining and
emboldening operations. Since
fold
without the
-b
option is dealing with these same constraints,
<backspace>
is always treated as backing up one column position rather than backing
up one character.

Historical versions of the
fold
utility assumed 1 byte was one character and occupied one column
position when written out. This is no longer always true. Since the
most common usage of
fold
is believed to be folding long lines for output to limited-length
output devices, this capability was preserved as the default case. The
-b
option was added so that applications could
fold
files with arbitrary length lines into text files that could then be
processed by the standard utilities. Note that although the width for
the
-b
option is in bytes, a line is never split in the middle of a character.
(It is unspecified what happens if a width is specified that is too
small to hold a single character found in the input followed by a
<newline>.)

The tab stops are hardcoded to be every eighth column to meet
historical practice. No new method of specifying other tab stops was
invented.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
