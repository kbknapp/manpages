NAME
ulimit
-- set or report file size limit
SYNOPSIS
ulimit [-f] [blocks]

DESCRIPTION
The
ulimit
utility shall set or report the file-size writing limit imposed on
files written by the shell and its child processes (files of any size
may be read). Only a process with appropriate privileges can increase
the limit.
OPTIONS
The
ulimit
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following option shall be supported:
-f 10
Set (or report, if no
blocks
operand is present), the file size limit in blocks. The
-f
option shall also be the default case.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
blocks 10
The number of 512-byte blocks to use as the new file size limit.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
ulimit :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The standard output shall be used when no
blocks
operand is present. If the current number of blocks is limited, the
number of blocks in the current limit shall be written in the following
format:
"%d\n", <number of 512-byte blocks>
If there is no current limit on the number of blocks, in the POSIX
locale the following format shall be used:
"unlimited\n"
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
A request for a higher limit was rejected or an error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
Since
ulimit
affects the current shell execution environment, it is always provided
as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a separate utility
execution environment, such as one of the following:
nohup ulimit -f 10000
env ulimit 10000
it does not affect the file size limit of the caller's environment.

Once a limit has been decreased by a process, it cannot be increased
(unless appropriate privileges are involved), even back to the original
system limit.
EXAMPLES
Set the file size limit to 51200 bytes:
ulimit -f 100
RATIONALE
None.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
