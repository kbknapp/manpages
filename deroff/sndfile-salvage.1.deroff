Audio files using the WAV file container are inherently limited to 4G of data
size fields in the WAV header being stored as unsigned 32bit integers.
Many applications have trouble with these WAV files
that are more the 4G in size.
sndfile-salvage rewrites the WAV file into a W64 file with the same audio content.
This file is overwritten if it already exists.
