This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
break
-- exit from for, while, or until loop
SYNOPSIS
break [n]

DESCRIPTION
The
break
utility shall exit from the smallest enclosing
for ,
while ,
or
until
loop, if any; or from the
n th
enclosing loop if
n
is specified. The value of
n
is an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal to 1. The default
shall be equivalent to
n =1.
If
n
is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing
loop shall be exited. Execution shall continue with the command
immediately following the loop.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
See the DESCRIPTION.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
None.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
Not used.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
The
n
value was not an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal to 1.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
for i in *
do
    if test -d "$i"
    then break
    fi
done

RATIONALE
In early proposals, consideration was given to expanding the syntax of
break
and
continue
to refer to a label associated with the appropriate loop as a
preferable alternative to the
n
method. However, this volume of POSIX.1-2008 does reserve the name space of command names
ending with a
<colon>.
It is anticipated that a future implementation could take advantage of
this and provide something like:
outofloop: for i in a b c d e
do
    for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    do
        if test -r "${i}${j}"
        then break outofloop
        fi
    done
done
and that this might be standardized after implementation experience is
achieved.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
