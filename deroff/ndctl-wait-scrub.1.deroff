NAME
ndctl-wait-scrub - wait for an Address Range Scrub (ARS) operation to complete
SYNOPSIS
ndctl wait-scrub [<bus-id> <bus-id2> ... <bus-idN>] [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

NVDIMM Address Range Scrub is a capability provided by platform firmware
that allows for the discovery of memory errors by system software. It
enables system software to pre-emptively avoid accesses that could lead
to uncorrectable memory error handling events, and it otherwise allows
memory errors to be enumerated.

The kernel provides a POLL(2) capable sysfs file (scrub) to indicate
the state of ARS. The scrub file maintains a running count of ARS runs
that have taken place. While a current run is in progress a +
character is emitted along with the current count. The ndctl
wait-scrub operation waits for scrub, across all specified buses, to
indicate not in-progress at least once.
EXAMPLE

Wait for scrub on all nvdimm buses in the system. The json listing
report at the end only includes the buses that support ARS operations.
# ndctl wait-scrub
[
  {
    "provider":"nfit_test.1",
    "dev":"ndbus3",
    "scrub_state":"idle"
  },
  {
    "provider":"nfit_test.0",
    "dev":"ndbus2",
    "scrub_state":"idle"
  }
]
When specifying an individual bus, or if there is only one bus in the
system, the command reports whether ARS support is available.
# ndctl wait-scrub e820
error waiting for scrub completion: Operation not supported
OPTIONS

-v, --verbose

Emit debug messages for the ARS wait process
