ts_test - A basic test routine for tslib.
SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

ts_test is used to manually test tslib using ts_read(). It draws a crosshair and mode buttons to the framebuffer and lets you test the behaviour of input samples with your configured filters applied, see ts.conf (5). Since it uses ts_read(), it supports single touch only.
