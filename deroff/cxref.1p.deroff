NAME
cxref
-- generate a C-language program cross-reference table
(DEVELOPMENT)
SYNOPSIS
cxref [-cs] [-o file] [-w num] [-D name[=def]]... [-I dir]...
    [-U name]... file...

DESCRIPTION
The
cxref
utility shall analyze a collection of C-language
file s
and attempt to build a cross-reference table. Information from
#define
lines shall be included in the symbol table. A sorted listing shall be
written to standard output of all symbols (auto, static, and global) in
each
file
separately, or with the
-c
option, in combination. Each symbol shall contain an
<asterisk>
before the declaring reference.
OPTIONS
The
cxref
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines,
except that the order of the
-D ,
-I ,
and
-U
options (which are identical to their interpretation by
c99 )
is significant. The following options shall be supported:
-c 10
Write a combined cross-reference of all input files.
-s 10
Operate silently; do not print input filenames.
-o file 10
Direct output to named
file .
-w num 10
Format output no wider than
num
(decimal) columns. This option defaults to 80 if
num
is not specified or is less than 51.
-D 10
Equivalent to
c99 .
-I 10
Equivalent to
c99 .
-U 10
Equivalent to
c99 .
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
file 10
A pathname of a C-language source file.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
The input files are C-language source files.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
cxref :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_COLLATE 10

Determine the locale for the ordering of the output.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The standard output shall be used for the cross-reference listing,
unless the
-o
option is used to select a different output file.

The format of standard output is unspecified, except that the following
information shall be included:
 * 4
If the
-c
option is not specified, each portion of the listing shall start
with the name of the input file on a separate line.
 * 4
The name line shall be followed by a sorted list of symbols, each with
its associated location pathname, the name of the function in which it
appears (if it is not a function name itself), and line number
references.
 * 4
Each line number may be preceded by an
<asterisk>
(c
'*' )
flag, meaning that this is the declaring reference. Other
single-character flags, with implementation-defined meanings, may be
included.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
The output file named by the
-o
option shall be used instead of standard output.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
None.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
