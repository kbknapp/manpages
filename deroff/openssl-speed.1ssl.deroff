SYNOPSIS

openssl speed

[ rand file...]
[ writerand file]
[ primes num]
[ seconds num]
[ bytes num]
[algorithm...]
DESCRIPTION

This command is used to test the performance of cryptographic algorithms.
To see the list of supported algorithms, use the list   digest commands
or list   cipher commands command. The global CSPRNG is denoted by
the rand algorithm name.
OPTIONS

 help 4

Print out a usage message.
 engine id 4

Specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause speed
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.
 elapsed 4

When calculating operations  or bytes per second, use wall clock time
instead of CPU user time as divisor. It can be useful when testing speed
of hardware engines.
 evp algo 4

Use the specified cipher or message digest algorithm via the EVP interface.
If algo is an AEAD cipher, then you can pass < aead> to benchmark a
TLS like sequence. And if algo is a multi buffer capable cipher, e.g.
aes 128 cbc hmac sha1, then  mb will time multi buffer operation.
 decrypt 4

Time the decryption instead of encryption. Affects only the EVP testing.
 rand file... 4

A file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator.
Multiple files can be specified separated by an OS dependent character.
The separator is ; for MS Windows, , for OpenVMS, and : for
all others.
[ writerand file] 4

Writes random data to the specified file upon exit.
This can be used with a subsequent  rand flag.
 primes num 4

Generate a num prime RSA key and use it to run the benchmarks. This option
is only effective if RSA algorithm is specified to test.
 seconds num 4

Run benchmarks for num seconds.
 bytes num 4

Run benchmarks on num byte buffers. Affects ciphers, digests and the CSPRNG.
[zero or more test algorithms] 4

If any options are given, speed tests those algorithms, otherwise a
pre compiled grand selection is tested.
