NAME
paste
-- merge corresponding or subsequent lines of files
SYNOPSIS
paste [-s] [-d list] file...

DESCRIPTION
The
paste
utility shall concatenate the corresponding lines of the given input
files, and write the resulting lines to standard output.

The default operation of
paste
shall concatenate the corresponding lines of the input files. The
<newline>
of every line except the line from the last input file shall be
replaced with a
<tab>.

If an end-of-file condition is detected on one or more input files, but
not all input files,
paste
shall behave as though empty lines were read from the files on which
end-of-file was detected, unless the
-s
option is specified.
OPTIONS
The
paste
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-d list 10
Unless a
<backslash>
character appears in
list ,
each character in
list
is an element specifying a delimiter character. If a
<backslash>
character appears in
list ,
the
<backslash>
character and one or more characters following it are an element
specifying a delimiter character as described below. These elements
specify one or more delimiters to use, instead of the default
<tab>,
to replace the
<newline>
of the input lines. The elements in
list
shall be used circularly; that is, when the list is exhausted the first
element from the list is reused. When the
-s
option is specified:

 * 4
The last
<newline>
in a file shall not be modified.
 * 4
The delimiter shall be reset to the first element of
list
after each
file
operand is processed.

When the
-s
option is not specified:
 * 4
The
<newline>
characters in the file specified by the last
file
operand shall not be modified.
 * 4
The delimiter shall be reset to the first element of list each time a
line is processed from each file.

If a
<backslash>
character appears in
list ,
it and the character following it shall be used to represent the
following delimiter characters:
\n 6
<newline>.
\t 6
<tab>.
\\ 6
<backslash>
character.
\0 6
Empty string (not a null character). If
'\0' 
is immediately followed by the character
'x' ,
the character
'X' ,
or any character defined by the
LC_CTYPE
digit
keyword (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Chapter 7 ,  Locale),
the results are unspecified.

If any other characters follow the
<backslash>,
the results are unspecified.

-s 10
Concatenate all of the lines of each separate input file in command
line order. The
<newline>
of every line except the last line in each input file shall be replaced
with the
<tab>,
unless otherwise specified by the
-d
option.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
file 10
A pathname of an input file. If
'-' 
is specified for one or more of the
file s,
the standard input shall be used; the standard input shall be read one
line at a time, circularly, for each instance of
'-' .
Implementations shall support pasting of at least 12
file
operands.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if one or more
file
operands is
'-' .
See the INPUT FILES section.
INPUT FILES
The input files shall be text files, except that line lengths shall be
unlimited.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
paste :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
Concatenated lines of input files shall be separated by the
<tab>
(or other characters under the control of the
-d
option) and terminated by a
<newline>.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
If one or more input files cannot be opened when the
-s
option is not specified, a diagnostic message shall be written to
standard error, but no output is written to standard output. If the
-s
option is specified, the
paste
utility shall provide the default behavior described in
Section 1.4 ,  Utility Description Defaults.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
When the escape sequences of the
list
option-argument are used in a shell script, they must be quoted;
otherwise, the shell treats the
<backslash>
as a special character.

Conforming applications should only use the specific
<backslash>-escaped
delimiters presented in this volume of POSIX.1-2008. Historical implementations treat
'\x' ,
where
'x' 
is not in this list, as
'x' ,
but future implementations are free to expand this list to recognize
other common escapes similar to those accepted by
printf
and other standard utilities.

Most of the standard utilities work on text files. The
cut
utility can be used to turn files with arbitrary line lengths into a
set of text files containing the same data. The
paste
utility can be used to create (or recreate) files with arbitrary line
lengths. For example, if
file
contains long lines:
cut -b 1-500 -n file > file1
cut -b 501- -n file > file2
creates
file1
(a text file) with lines no longer than 500 bytes (plus the
<newline>)
and
file2
that contains the remainder of the data from
file .
Note that
file2
is not a text file if there are lines in
file
that are longer than 500 +
{LINE_MAX}
bytes. The original file can be recreated from
file1
and
file2
using the command:
paste -d "\0" file1 file2 > file
The commands:
paste -d "\0" ...
paste -d "" ...
are not necessarily equivalent; the latter is not specified by this volume of POSIX.1-2008
and may result in an error. The construct
'\0' 
is used to mean ``no separator'' because historical versions of
paste
did not follow the syntax guidelines, and the command:
paste -d"" ...
could not be handled properly by
getopt().
EXAMPLES
 1. 4
Write out a directory in four columns:
ls | paste - - - -
 2. 4
Combine pairs of lines from a file into single lines:
paste -s -d "\t\n" file
RATIONALE
None.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
