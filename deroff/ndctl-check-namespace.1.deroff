NAME
ndctl-check-namespace - check namespace metadata consistency
SYNOPSIS
ndctl check-namespace <namespace> [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

A namespace in the sector mode will have metadata on it to describe
the kernel BTT (Block Translation Table). The check-namespace command
can be used to check the consistency of this metadata, and optionally,
also attempt to repair it, if it has enough information to do so.

The namespace being checked has to be disabled before initiating a
check on it as a precautionary measure. The --force option can override
this.
EXAMPLES

Check a namespace (only report errors)
ndctl disable-namespace namespace0.0
ndctl check-namespace namespace0.0
Check a namespace, and perform repairs if possible
ndctl disable-namespace namespace0.0
ndctl check-namespace --repair namespace0.0
OPTIONS

-R, --repair

Perform metadata repairs if possible. Without this option,
the raw namespace contents will not be touched.
-L, --rewrite-log

Regenerate the BTT log and write it to media. This can be used to
convert from the old (pre 4.15) padding format that was incompatible
with other BTT implementations to the updated format. This requires
the --repair option to be provided.
WARNING: Do not interrupt this operation as it can potentially cause
unrecoverable metadata corruption. It is highly recommended to create
a backup of the raw namespace before attempting this.
-f, --force

Unless this option is specified, a check-namespace operation
will fail if the namespace is presently active. Specifying
--force causes the namespace to be disabled before checking.
-v, --verbose

Emit debug messages for the namespace check process.
-r, --region=
A 'regionX' device name, or a region id number. The keyword 'all' can
be specified to carry out the operation on every region in the system,
optionally filtered by bus id (see --bus= option).
-b, --bus=

Enforce that the operation only be carried on devices that are
attached to the given bus. Where bus can be a provider name or a bus
id number.
