COMMANDS

The following commands are understood:

list [LINK...]

Show a list of existing links and their status. If no further arguments are specified shows all links, otherwise just the specified links. Produces output similar to:
IDX LINK         TYPE     OPERATIONAL SETUP
  1 lo           loopback carrier     unmanaged
  2 eth0         ether    routable    configured
  3 virbr0       ether    no-carrier  unmanaged
  4 virbr0-nic   ether    off         unmanaged

4 links listed.
The operational status is one of the following:

off

the device is powered down
no-carrier

the device is powered up, but it does not yet have a carrier
dormant

the device has a carrier, but is not yet ready for normal traffic
carrier

the link has a carrier
degraded

the link has carrier and addresses valid on the local link configured
routable

the link has carrier and routable address configured
The setup status is one of the following:

pending

udev is still processing the link, we dont yet know if we will manage it
failed

networkd failed to manage the link
configuring

in the process of retrieving configuration or configuring the link
configured

link configured successfully
unmanaged

networkd is not handling the link
linger

the link is gone, but has not yet been dropped by networkd
status [LINK...]

Show information about the specified links: type, state, kernel module driver, hardware and IP address, configured DNS servers, etc.

When no links are specified, an overall network status is shown. Also see the option
--all.

Produces output similar to:
‚óè      State: routable
     Address: 10.193.76.5 on eth0
              192.168.122.1 on virbr0
              169.254.190.105 on eth0
              fe80::5054:aa:bbbb:cccc on eth0
     Gateway: 10.193.11.1 (CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.) on eth0
         DNS: 8.8.8.8
              8.8.4.4
lldp [LINK...]

Show discovered LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) neighbors. If one or more link names are specified only neighbors on those interfaces are shown. Otherwise shows discovered neighbors on all interfaces. Note that for this feature to work,
LLDP=
must be turned on for the specific interface, see
systemd.network(5)
for details.

Produces output similar to:

t - Telephone; d - DOCSIS cable device; a - Station; c - Customer VLAN;
s - Service VLAN, m - Two-port MAC Relay (TPMR)

1 neighbors listed.
label

Show numerical address labels that can be used for address selection. This is the same information that
ip-addrlabel(8)
shows. See
m[blue]RFC 3484m[]\u[1]\d
for a discussion of address labels.

Produces output similar to:
