NAME
iconv
-- codeset conversion
SYNOPSIS
iconv [-cs] -f frommap -t tomap [file...]

iconv -f fromcode [-cs] [-t tocode] [file...]

iconv -t tocode [-cs] [-f fromcode] [file...]

iconv -l

DESCRIPTION
The
iconv
utility shall convert the encoding of characters in
file
from one codeset to another and write the results to standard output.

When the options indicate that charmap files are used to specify the
codesets (see OPTIONS), the codeset conversion shall be accomplished by
performing a logical join on the symbolic character names in the two
charmaps. The implementation need not support the use of charmap files
for codeset conversion unless the POSIX2_LOCALEDEF symbol is defined on
the system.
OPTIONS
The
iconv
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-c 10
Omit any characters that are invalid in the codeset of the input file
from the output. When
-c
is not used, the results of encountering invalid characters in the
input stream (either those that are not characters in the codeset of
the input file or that have no corresponding character in the codeset
of the output file) shall be specified in the system documentation. The
presence or absence of
-c
shall not affect the exit status of
iconv .
-f fromcodeset 10

Identify the codeset of the input file. The implementation shall
recognize the following two forms of the
fromcodeset
option-argument:

fromcode 10
The
fromcode
option-argument must not contain a
<slash>
character. It shall be interpreted as the name of one of the codeset
descriptions provided by the implementation in an unspecified
format. Valid values of
fromcode
are implementation-defined.
frommap 10
The
frommap
option-argument must contain a
<slash>
character. It shall be interpreted as the pathname of a charmap file as
defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 6.4 ,  Character Set Description File.
If the pathname does not represent a valid, readable charmap file,
the results are undefined.

If this option is omitted, the codeset of the current locale shall
be used.

-l 10
Write all supported
fromcode
and
tocode
values to standard output in an unspecified format.
-s 10
Suppress any messages written to standard error concerning invalid
characters. When
-s
is not used, the results of encountering invalid characters in the
input stream (either those that are not valid characters in the codeset
of the input file or that have no corresponding character in the
codeset of the output file) shall be specified in the system
documentation. The presence or absence of
-s
shall not affect the exit status of
iconv .
-t tocodeset 10
Identify the codeset to be used for the output file. The implementation
shall recognize the following two forms of the
tocodeset
option-argument:

tocode 10
The semantics shall be equivalent to the
-f
fromcode
option.
tomap 10
The semantics shall be equivalent to the
-f
frommap
option.

If this option is omitted, the codeset of the current locale shall be
used.
If either
-f
or
-t
represents a charmap file, but the other does not (or is omitted), or
both
-f
and
-t
are omitted, the results are undefined.
OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
file 10
A pathname of an input file. If no
file
operands are specified, or if a
file
operand is
'-' ,
the standard input shall be used.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if no
file
operands are specified, or if a
file
operand is
'-' .
INPUT FILES
The input file shall be a text file.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
iconv :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments). During translation of the file,
this variable is superseded by the use of the
fromcode
option-argument.
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
When the
-l
option is used, the standard output shall contain all supported
fromcode
and
tocode
values, written in an unspecified format.

When the
-l
option is not used, the standard output shall contain the sequence of
characters read from the input files, translated to the specified
codeset. Nothing else shall be written to the standard output.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
The user must ensure that both charmap files use the same symbolic
names for characters the two codesets have in common.
EXAMPLES
The following example converts the contents of file
mail.x400
from the ISO/IEC 6937:2001 standard codeset to the ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998 standard codeset, and stores the results in
file
mail.local :
iconv -f IS6937 -t IS8859 mail.x400 > mail.local
RATIONALE
The
iconv
utility can be used portably only when the user provides two charmap
files as option-arguments. This is because a single charmap provided by
the user cannot reliably be joined with the names in a system-provided
character set description. The valid values for
fromcode
and
tocode
are implementation-defined and do not have to have any relation to
the charmap mechanisms. As an aid to interactive users, the
-l
option was adopted from the Plan 9 operating system. It writes
information concerning these implementation-defined values. The
format is unspecified because there are many possible useful formats
that could be chosen, such as a matrix of valid combinations of
fromcode
and
tocode .
The
-l
option is not intended for shell script usage; conforming applications
will have to use charmaps.

The
iconv
utility may support the conversion between ASCII and EBCDIC-based
encodings, but is not required to do so. In an XSI-compliant
implementation, the
dd
utility is the only method guaranteed to support conversion between
these two character sets.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
