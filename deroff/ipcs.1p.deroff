NAME
ipcs
-- report XSI interprocess communication facilities status
SYNOPSIS
ipcs [-qms] [-a|-bcopt]

DESCRIPTION
The
ipcs
utility shall write information about active interprocess communication
facilities.

Without options, information shall be written in short format for
message queues, shared memory segments, and semaphore sets that are
currently active in the system. Otherwise, the information that is
displayed is controlled by the options specified.
OPTIONS
The
ipcs
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The
ipcs
utility accepts the following options:
-q 10
Write information about active message queues.
-m 10
Write information about active shared memory segments.
-s 10
Write information about active semaphore sets.

If
-q ,
-m ,
or
-s
are specified, only information about those facilities shall be
written. If none of these three are specified, information about all
three shall be written subject to the following options:
-a 10
Use all print options. (This is a shorthand notation for
-b ,
-c ,
-o ,
-p ,
and
-t .)
-b 10
Write information on maximum allowable size. (Maximum number of bytes
in messages on queue for message queues, size of segments for shared
memory, and number of semaphores in each set for semaphores.)
-c 10
Write creator's user name and group name; see below.
-o 10
Write information on outstanding usage. (Number of messages on queue
and total number of bytes in messages on queue for message queues, and
number of processes attached to shared memory segments.)
-p 10
Write process number information. (Process ID of the last process to
send a message and process ID of the last process to receive a message
on message queues, process ID of the creating process, and process ID
of the last process to attach or detach on shared memory segments.)
-t 10
Write time information. (Time of the last control operation that
changed the access permissions for all facilities, time of the last
msgsnd()
and
msgrcv()
operations on message queues, time of the last
shmat()
and
shmdt()
operations on shared memory, and time of the last
semop()
operation on semaphores.)
OPERANDS
None.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
 * 4
The group database
 * 4
The user database
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
ipcs :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
TZ 10
Determine the timezone for the date and time strings written by
ipcs .
If
TZ
is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
An introductory line shall be written with the format:
"IPC status from %s as of %s\n", <source>, <date>
where <source> indicates the source used to gather the statistics
and <date> is the information that would be produced by the
date
command when invoked in the POSIX locale.

The
ipcs
utility then shall create up to three reports depending upon the
-q ,
-m ,
and
-s
options. The first report shall indicate the status of message queues,
the second report shall indicate the status of shared memory segments,
and the third report shall indicate the status of semaphore sets.

If the corresponding facility is not installed or has not been used
since the last reboot, then the report shall be written out in the
format:
"%s facility not in system.\n", <facility>
where <facility> is
Message Queue ,
Shared Memory ,
or
Semaphore ,
as appropriate. If the facility has been installed and has been used
since the last reboot, column headings separated by one or more
<space>
characters and followed by a
<newline>
shall be written as indicated below followed by the facility name
written out using the format:
"%s:\n", <facility>
where <facility> is
Message Queues ,
Shared Memory ,
or
Semaphores ,
as appropriate. On the second and third reports the column headings
need not be written if the last column headings written already provide
column headings for all information in that report.

The column headings provided in the first column below and the meaning
of the information in those columns shall be given in order below; the
letters in parentheses indicate the options that shall cause the
corresponding column to appear; ``all'' means that the column shall
always appear. Each column is separated by one or more
<space>
characters. Note that these options only determine what information is
provided for each report; they do not determine which reports are written.
T (all) 12
Type of facility:

q 8
Message queue.
m 8
Shared memory segment.
s 8
Semaphore.

This field is a single character written using the format
%c .

ID (all) 12
The identifier for the facility entry. This field shall be written
using the format
%d .
KEY (all) 12
The key used as an argument to
msgget(),
semget(),
or
shmget()
to create the facility entry.
Note:
The key of a shared memory segment is changed to IPC_PRIVATE when the
segment has been removed until all processes attached to the segment
detach it.

This field shall be written using the format 0x%x.

MODE (all) 12
The facility access modes and flags. The mode shall consist of 11
characters that are interpreted as follows.
The first character shall be:
S 8
If a process is waiting on a
msgsnd()
operation.
- 8
If the above is not true.

The second character shall be:
R 8
If a process is waiting on a
msgrcv()
operation.
C or - 8
If the associated shared memory segment is to be cleared when the first
attach operation is executed.
- 8
If none of the above is true.

The next nine characters shall be interpreted as three sets of three
bits each. The first set refers to the owner's permissions; the next
to permissions of others in the usergroup of the facility entry; and
the last to all others. Within each set, the first character indicates
permission to read, the second character indicates permission to write
or alter the facility entry, and the last character is a minus-sign (c
'-' ).

The permissions shall be indicated as follows:
r 8
If read permission is granted.
w 8
If write permission is granted.
a 8
If alter permission is granted.
- 8
If the indicated permission is not granted.

The first character following the permissions specifies if there is an
alternate or additional access control method associated with the
facility. If there is no alternate or additional access control method
associated with the facility, a single
<space>
shall be written; otherwise, another printable character is
written.

OWNER (all) 12
The user name of the owner of the facility entry. If the user name of
the owner is found in the user database, at least the first eight
column positions of the name shall be written using the format
