NAME
alias
-- define or display aliases
SYNOPSIS
alias [alias-name[=string]...]

DESCRIPTION
The
alias
utility shall create or redefine alias definitions or write the values
of existing alias definitions to standard output. An alias definition
provides a string value that shall replace a command name when it is
encountered; see
Section 2.3.1 ,  Alias Substitution.

An alias definition shall affect the current shell execution
environment and the execution environments of the subshells of the
current shell. When used as specified by this volume of POSIX.1-2008, the alias definition
shall not affect the parent process of the current shell nor any
utility environment invoked by the shell; see
Section 2.12 ,  Shell Execution Environment.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
The following operands shall be supported:
alias-name 10
Write the alias definition to standard output.
alias-name=string 10

Assign the value of
string
to the alias
alias-name .

If no operands are given, all alias definitions shall be written to
standard output.
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
alias :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The format for displaying aliases (when no operands or only
name
operands are specified) shall be:
"%s=%s\n", name, value
The
value
string shall be written with appropriate quoting so that it is suitable
for reinput to the shell. See the description of shell quoting in
Section 2.2 ,  Quoting.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
One of the
name
operands specified did not have an alias definition, or an error
occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
 1. 4
Create a short alias for a commonly used
ls
command:
alias lf="ls -CF"
 2. 4
Create a simple ``redo'' command to repeat previous entries in the
command history file:
alias r='fc -s'
 3. 4
Use 1K units for
du :
alias du=du\ -k
 4. 4
Set up
nohup
so that it can deal with an argument that is itself an alias name:
alias nohup="nohup "
RATIONALE
The
alias
description is based on historical KornShell implementations. Known
differences exist between that and the C shell. The KornShell version
was adopted to be consistent with all the other KornShell features in
this volume of POSIX.1-2008, such as command line editing.

Since
alias
affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally
provided as a shell regular built-in.

Historical versions of the KornShell have allowed aliases to be
exported to scripts that are invoked by the same shell. This is
triggered by the
alias
-x
flag; it is allowed by this volume of POSIX.1-2008 only when an explicit extension such as
-x
is used. The standard developers considered that aliases were of use
primarily to interactive users and that they should normally not affect
shell scripts called by those users; functions are available to such
scripts.

Historical versions of the KornShell had not written aliases in a
quoted manner suitable for reentry to the shell, but this volume of POSIX.1-2008 has made
this a requirement for all similar output. Therefore, consistency was
chosen over this detail of historical practice.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
