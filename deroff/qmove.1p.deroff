NAME
qmove
-- move batch jobs
SYNOPSIS
qmove destination job_identifier...

DESCRIPTION
To move a batch job is to remove the batch job from the batch queue in
which it resides and instantiate the batch job in another batch queue.
A batch job is moved by a request to the batch server that manages the
batch job. The
qmove
utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests the movement of
one or more batch jobs.

The
qmove
utility shall move those batch jobs, and only those batch jobs, for
which a batch
job_identifier
is presented to the utility.

The
qmove
utility shall move batch jobs in the order in which the corresponding
batch
job_identifier s
are presented to the utility.

If the
qmove
utility fails to process a batch
job_identifier
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining batch
job_identifier s,
if any.

The
qmove
utility shall move batch jobs by sending a
Move Job Request
to the batch server that manages each batch job. The
qmove
utility shall not exit before the batch jobs corresponding to all
successfully processed batch
job_identifier s
have been moved.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
The
qmove
utility shall accept one operand that conforms to the syntax for a
destination (see
Section 3.3.2 ,  Destination).

The
qmove
utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax
for a batch
job_identifier
(see
Section 3.3.1 ,  Batch Job Identifier).
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
qmove :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
LOGNAME 10
Determine the login name of the user.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
None.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
In addition to the default behavior, the
qmove
utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates that
the batch
job_identifier
does not exist on the server. Whether or not the
qmove
utility waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to
locate the job on other servers is implementation-defined.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The
qmove
utility allows users to move jobs between queues.

The alternative to using the
qmove
utility--deleting the batch job and requeuing it--entails
considerably more typing.

Since the means of selecting jobs based on attributes has been
encapsulated in the
qselect
utility, the only option of the
qmove
utility concerns authorization. The
-u
option provides the user with the convenience of changing the user
identifier under which the batch job will execute. Minimalism and
consistency have taken precedence over convenience; the
-u
option has been deleted because the equivalent capability exists with
the
-u
option of the
qalter
utility.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The
qmove
utility may be removed in a future version.
