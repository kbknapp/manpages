NAME
ndctl-start-scrub - start an Address Range Scrub (ARS) operation
SYNOPSIS
ndctl start-scrub [<bus-id> <bus-id2> ... <bus-idN>] [<options>]
DESCRIPTION

NVDIMM Address Range Scrub is a capability provided by platform firmware
that allows for the discovery of memory errors by system software. It
enables system software to pre-emptively avoid accesses that could lead
to uncorrectable memory error handling events, and it otherwise allows
memory errors to be enumerated.

The kernel provides a sysfs file (scrub) that when written with the
string "1\n" initiates an ARS operation. The ndctl start-scrub
operation starts an ARS, across all specified buses, and the kernel in
turn proceeds to scrub every persistent memory address region on the
specified buses.
EXAMPLE

Start a scrub on all nvdimm buses in the system. The json listing report
only includes the buses that support ARS operations.
# ndctl start-scrub
[
  {
    "provider":"nfit_test.1",
    "dev":"ndbus3",
    "scrub_state":"active"
  },
  {
    "provider":"nfit_test.0",
    "dev":"ndbus2",
    "scrub_state":"active"
  }
]
When specifying an individual bus, or if there is only one bus in the
system, the command reports whether ARS support is available.
# ndctl start-scrub e820
error starting scrub: Operation not supported
OPTIONS

-v, --verbose

Emit debug messages for the ARS start process
