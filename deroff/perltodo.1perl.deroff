NAME
perltodo   Link to the Perl to do list
DESCRIPTION

The Perl 5 to do list is maintained in the git repository, and can
be viewed at <http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/Porting/todo.pod>

(The to do list used to be here in perltodo. That has stopped, as installing a
snapshot that becomes increasingly out of date isn't that useful to anyone.)
