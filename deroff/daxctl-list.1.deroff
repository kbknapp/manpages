NAME
daxctl-list - dump the platform Device-DAX regions, devices, and attributes in json.
SYNOPSIS
daxctl list [<options>]
Walk all the device-dax-regions in the system and list all device
instances along with some of their major attributes.

Options can be specified to limit the output to objects of a certain
class.  Where the classes are regions or devices.  By default, daxctl
list with no options is equivalent to:
daxctl list --devices
EXAMPLE
# daxctl list --regions --devices

{
  "id":1,
  "devices":[
    {
      "chardev":"dax1.0",
      "size":3233808384
    }
  ]
}
OPTIONS

-r, --region=

A device-dax region is a contiguous range of memory that
hosts one or more /dev/daxX.Y devices, where X is the region id
and Y is the device instance id. The keyword all can be
specified to carry out the operation on every region in the
system.
-d, --dev=

Specify a dax device name, <region id>.<instance id>
tuple, or keyword all to filter the listing. For
example to list the first device instance in region1:
# daxctl list --dev=1.0

{
  "chardev":"dax1.0",
  "size":3233808384
}
-D, --devices

Include device-dax instance info in the listing (default)
-R, --regions

Include region info in the listing
-i, --idle

Include idle (not enabled / zero-sized) devices in the listing
-u, --human

By default daxctl list will output machine-friendly raw-integer
data. Instead, with this flag, numbers representing storage size
will be formatted as human readable strings with units, other
fields are converted to hexadecimal strings.  Example:
# daxctl list
{
  "chardev":"dax1.0",
  "size":32828817408
}

# daxctl list --human
{
  "chardev":"dax1.0",
  "size":"30.57 GiB (32.83 GB)"
}
