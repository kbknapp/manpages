NAME
at
-- execute commands at a later time
SYNOPSIS
at [-m] [-f file] [-q queuename] -t time_arg

at [-m] [-f file] [-q queuename] timespec...

at -r at_job_id...

at -l -q queuename

at -l [at_job_id...]

DESCRIPTION
The
at
utility shall read commands from standard input and group them together
as an
at-job ,
to be executed at a later time.

The at-job shall be executed in a separate invocation of the shell,
running in a separate process group with no controlling terminal,
except that the environment variables, current working directory,
file creation mask, and other implementation-defined execution-time
attributes in effect when the
at
utility is executed shall be retained and used when the at-job is
executed.

When the at-job is submitted, the
at_job_id
and scheduled time shall be written to standard error. The
at_job_id
is an identifier that shall be a string consisting solely of
alphanumeric characters and the
<period>
character. The
at_job_id
shall be assigned by the system when the job is scheduled such that it
uniquely identifies a particular job.

User notification and the processing of the job's standard output and
standard error are described under the
-m
option.

Users shall be permitted to use
at
if their name appears in the file
at.allow
which is located in an implementation-defined directory.
If that file does not exist, the file
at.deny ,
which is located in an implementation-defined directory,
shall be checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to
at .
If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges
shall be allowed to submit a job. If only
at.deny
exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The
at.allow
and
at.deny
files shall consist of one user name per line.
OPTIONS
The
at
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-f file 10
Specify the pathname of a file to be used as the source of the at-job,
instead of standard input.
-l 10
(The letter ell.) Report all jobs scheduled for the invoking user if no
at_job_id
operands are specified. If
at_job_id s
are specified, report only information for these jobs. The output shall
be written to standard output.
-m 10
Send mail to the invoking user after the at-job has run, announcing its
completion. Standard output and standard error produced by the at-job
shall be mailed to the user as well, unless redirected elsewhere. Mail
shall be sent even if the job produces no output.
If
-m
is not used, the job's standard output and standard error shall be
provided to the user by means of mail, unless they are redirected
elsewhere; if there is no such output to provide, the implementation
need not notify the user of the job's completion.

-q queuename 10

Specify in which queue to schedule a job for submission. When used with
the
-l
option, limit the search to that particular queue. By default, at-jobs
shall be scheduled in queue
a .
In contrast, queue
b
shall be reserved for batch jobs; see
batch .
The meanings of all other
queuename s
are implementation-defined. If
-q
is specified along with either of the
-t
time_arg
or
timespec
arguments, the results are unspecified.
-r 10
Remove the jobs with the specified
at_job_id
operands that were previously scheduled by the
at
utility.
-t time_arg 10
Submit the job to be run at the time specified by the
time
option-argument, which the application shall ensure has the format as
specified by the
touch
-t
time
utility.
OPERANDS
The following operands shall be supported:
at_job_id 10
The name reported by a previous invocation of the
at
utility at the time the job was scheduled.
timespec 10
Submit the job to be run at the date and time specified. All of the
timespec
operands are interpreted as if they were separated by
<space>
characters and concatenated, and shall be parsed as described in the
grammar at the end of this section. The date and time shall be interpreted
as being in the timezone of the user (as determined by the
TZ
variable), unless a timezone name appears as part of
time ,
below.
In the POSIX locale, the following describes the three parts of the
time specification string. All of the values from the
LC_TIME
categories in the POSIX locale shall be recognized in a
case-insensitive manner.
time 10
The time can be specified as one, two, or four digits. One-digit and
two-digit numbers shall be taken to be hours; four-digit numbers to be
hours and minutes. The time can alternatively be specified as two
numbers separated by a
<colon>,
meaning hour:minute. An AM/PM indication (one of the values
from the
am_pm
keywords in the
LC_TIME
locale category) can follow the time; otherwise, a 24-hour clock time
shall be understood. A timezone name can also follow to further qualify
the time. The acceptable timezone names are implementation-defined,
except that they shall be case-insensitive and the string
utc
is supported to indicate the time is in Coordinated Universal Time.
In the POSIX locale, the
time
field can also be one of the following tokens:

midnight 10
Indicates the time 12:00 am (00:00).
noon 10
Indicates the time 12:00 pm.
now 10
Indicates the current day and time. Invoking
at
<now> shall submit an at-job for potentially immediate execution
(that is, subject only to unspecified scheduling delays).

date 10
An optional
date
can be specified as either a month name (one of the values from the
mon
or
abmon
keywords in the
LC_TIME
locale category) followed by a day number (and possibly year number
preceded by a comma), or a day of the week (one of the values from the
day
or
abday
keywords in the
LC_TIME
locale category). In the POSIX locale, two special days shall be
recognized:

today 10
Indicates the current day.
tomorrow 10
Indicates the day following the current day.

If no
date
is given,
today
shall be assumed if the given time is greater than the current time,
and
tomorrow
shall be assumed if it is less. If the given month is less than the
current month (and no year is given), next year shall be assumed.

increment 10
The optional
increment
shall be a number preceded by a
<plus-sign>
(c
'+' )
and suffixed by one of the following:
minutes ,
hours ,
days ,
weeks ,
months ,
or
years .
(The singular forms shall also be accepted.) The keyword
next
shall be equivalent to an increment number of +1. For example, the
following are equivalent commands:
at 2pm + 1 week
at 2pm next week
The following grammar describes the precise format of
timespec
in the POSIX locale. The general conventions for this style of grammar
are described in
Section 1.3 ,  Grammar Conventions.
This formal syntax shall take precedence over the preceding text syntax
description. The longest possible token or delimiter shall be
recognized at a given point. When used in a
timespec ,
white space shall also delimit tokens.

STDIN
The standard input shall be a text file consisting of commands
acceptable to the shell command language described in
Chapter 2 ,  Shell Command Language.
The standard input shall only be used if no
-f
file
option is specified.
INPUT FILES
See the STDIN section.

The text files
at.allow
and
at.deny ,
which are located in an implementation-defined directory,
shall contain zero or more user names, one per line, of users who are,
respectively, authorized or denied access to the
at
and
batch
utilities.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
at :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and
informative messages written to standard output.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
LC_TIME 10
Determine the format and contents for date and time strings written and
accepted by
at .
SHELL 10
Determine a name of a command interpreter to be used to invoke the
at-job. If the variable is unset or null,
sh
shall be used. If it is set to a value other than a name for
sh ,
the implementation shall do one of the following: use that shell; use
sh ;
use the login shell from the user database; or any of the preceding
accompanied by a warning diagnostic about which was chosen.
TZ 10
Determine the timezone. The job shall be submitted for execution at the
time specified by
timespec
or
-t
time
relative to the timezone specified by the
TZ
variable. If
timespec
specifies a timezone, it shall override
TZ .
If
timespec
does not specify a timezone and
TZ
is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
When standard input is a terminal, prompts of unspecified format for
each line of the user input described in the STDIN section may be
written to standard output.

In the POSIX locale, the following shall be written to the standard
output for each job when jobs are listed in response to the
-l
option:
"%s\t%s\n", at_job_id, <date>
where
date
shall be equivalent in format to the output of:
date +"%a %b %e %T %Y"
The date and time written shall be adjusted so that they appear in the
timezone of the user (as determined by the
TZ
variable).
STDERR
In the POSIX locale, the following shall be written to standard error
when a job has been successfully submitted:
"job %s at %s\n", at_job_id, <date>
where
date
has the same format as that described in the STDOUT section. Neither
this, nor warning messages concerning the selection of the command
interpreter, shall be considered a diagnostic that changes the exit
status.

Diagnostic messages, if any, shall be written to standard error.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
The
at
utility successfully submitted, removed, or listed a job or jobs.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
The job shall not be scheduled, removed, or listed.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
The format of the
at
command line shown here is guaranteed only for the POSIX locale. Other
cultures may be supported with substantially different interfaces,
although implementations are encouraged to provide comparable levels of
functionality.

Since the commands run in a separate shell invocation, running in a
separate process group with no controlling terminal, open file
descriptors, traps, and priority inherited from the invoking
environment are lost.

Some implementations do not allow substitution of different shells
using
SHELL .
System V systems, for example, have used the login shell value for the
user in
/etc/passwd .
To select reliably another command interpreter, the user must include
it as part of the script, such as:
$ at 1800
myshell myscript
EOT
job ... at ...
$
EXAMPLES
 1. 4
This sequence can be used at a terminal:
at -m 0730 tomorrow
sort < file >outfile
EOT
 2. 4
This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting standard error to a pipe,
is useful in a command procedure (the sequence of output redirection
specifications is significant):
at now + 1 hour <<!
diff file1 file2 2>&1 >outfile | mailx mygroup
!
 3. 4
To have a job reschedule itself,
at
can be invoked from within the at-job. For example, this daily
processing script named
my.daily
runs every day (although
crontab
is a more appropriate vehicle for such work):
# my.daily runs every day
daily processing
at now tomorrow < my.daily
 4. 4
The spacing of the three portions of the POSIX locale
timespec
is quite flexible as long as there are no ambiguities. Examples of
various times and operand presentation include:
at 0815am Jan 24
at 8 :15amjan24
at now "+ 1day"
at 5 pm FRIday
at '17
    utc+
    30minutes'
RATIONALE
The
at
utility reads from standard input the commands to be executed at a
later time. It may be useful to redirect standard output and standard
error within the specified commands.

The
-t
time
option was added as a new capability to support an internationalized
way of specifying a time for execution of the submitted job.

Early proposals added a ``jobname'' concept as a way of giving
submitted jobs names that are meaningful to the user submitting them.
The historical, system-specified
at_job_id
gives no indication of what the job is. Upon further reflection, it was
decided that the benefit of this was not worth the change in historical
interface. The
at
functionality is useful in simple environments, but in large or complex
situations, the functionality provided by the Batch Services option is
more suitable.

The
-q
option historically has been an undocumented option, used mainly by the
batch
utility.

The System V
-m
option was added to provide a method for informing users that an at-job
had completed. Otherwise, users are only informed when output to
standard error or standard output are not redirected.

The behavior of
at
<now> was changed in an early proposal from being unspecified to
submitting a job for potentially immediate execution. Historical BSD
at
implementations support this. Historical System V implementations give
an error in that case, but a change to the System V versions should
have no backwards-compatibility ramifications.

On BSD-based systems, a
-u
user
option has allowed those with appropriate privileges to access the work
of other users. Since this is primarily a system administration feature
and is not universally implemented, it has been omitted. Similarly, a
specification for the output format for a user with appropriate
privileges viewing the queues of other users has been omitted.

The
-f
file
option from System V is used instead of the BSD method of using the
last operand as the pathname. The BSD method is ambiguous--does:
at 1200 friday
mean the same thing if there is a file named
friday
in the current directory?

The
at_job_id
is composed of a limited character set in historical practice, and it
is mandated here to invalidate systems that might try using characters
that require shell quoting or that could not be easily parsed by shell
scripts.

The
at
utility varies between System V and BSD systems in the way timezones
are used. On System V systems, the
TZ
variable affects the at-job submission times and the times displayed
for the user. On BSD systems,
TZ
is not taken into account. The BSD behavior is easily achieved with
the current specification. If the user wishes to have the timezone
default to that of the system, they merely need to issue the
at
command immediately following an unsetting or null assignment to
TZ .
For example:
TZ= at noon ...
gives the desired BSD result.

While the
yacc -like
grammar specified in the OPERANDS section is lexically unambiguous with
respect to the digit strings, a lexical analyzer would probably be
written to look for and return digit strings in those cases. The parser
could then check whether the digit string returned is a valid
day_number ,
year_number ,
and so on, based on the context.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
