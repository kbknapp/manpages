NAME
join
-- relational database operator
SYNOPSIS
join [-a file_number|-v file_number] [-e string] [-o list] [-t char]
    [-1 field] [-2 field] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
The
join
utility shall perform an equality join on the files
file1
and
file2 .
The joined files shall be written to the standard output.

The join field is a field in each file on which the files are
compared. The
join
utility shall write one line in the output for each pair of lines in
file1
and
file2
that have identical join fields. The output line by default shall
consist of the join field, then the remaining fields from
file1 ,
then the remaining fields from
file2 .
This format can be changed by using the
-o
option (see below). The
-a
option can be used to add unmatched lines to the output. The
-v
option can be used to output only unmatched lines.

The files
file1
and
file2
shall be ordered in the collating sequence of
sort
-b
on the fields on which they shall be joined, by default the first in
each line. All selected output shall be written in the same collating
sequence.

The default input field separators shall be
<blank>
characters. In this case, multiple separators shall count as one field
separator, and leading separators shall be ignored. The default output
field separator shall be a
<space>.

The field separator and collating sequence can be changed by using the
-t
option (see below).

If the same key appears more than once in either file, all combinations
of the set of remaining fields in
file1
and the set of remaining fields in
file2
are output in the order of the lines encountered.

If the input files are not in the appropriate collating sequence, the
results are unspecified.
OPTIONS
The
join
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.

The following options shall be supported:
-a file_number 10

Produce a line for each unpairable line in file
file_number ,
where
file_number
is 1 or 2, in addition to the default output. If both
-a 1
and
-a 2
are specified, all unpairable lines shall be output.
-e string 10
Replace empty output fields in the list selected by
-o
with the string
string .
-o list 10
Construct the output line to comprise the fields specified in
list ,
each element of which shall have one of the following two forms:

 1. 4
file_number.field, where
file_number
is a file number and
field
is a decimal integer field number
 2. 4
0 (zero), representing the join field

The elements of
list
shall be either
<comma>-separated
or
<blank>-separated,
as specified in Guideline 8 of the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 12.2 ,  Utility Syntax Guidelines.
The fields specified by
list
shall be written for all selected output lines. Fields selected by
list
that do not appear in the input shall be treated as empty output
fields. (See the
-e
option.) Only specifically requested fields shall be written. The
application shall ensure that
list
is a single command line argument.

-t char 10
Use character
char
as a separator, for both input and output. Every appearance of
char
in a line shall be significant. When this option is specified, the
collating sequence shall be the same as
sort
without the
-b
option.
-v file_number 10

Instead of the default output, produce a line only for each unpairable
line in
file_number ,
where
file_number
is 1 or 2. If both
-v 1
and
-v 2
are specified, all unpairable lines shall be output.
-1 field 10
Join on the
field th
field of file 1. Fields are decimal integers starting with 1.
-2 field 10
Join on the
field th
field of file 2. Fields are decimal integers starting with 1.
OPERANDS
The following operands shall be supported:
file1, file2 10
A pathname of a file to be joined. If either of the
file1
or
file2
operands is
'-' ,
the standard input shall be used in its place.
STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if the
file1
or
file2
operand is
'-' .
See the INPUT FILES section.
INPUT FILES
The input files shall be text files.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
join :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_COLLATE 10

Determine the locale of the collating sequence
join
expects to have been used when the input files were sorted.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
NLSPATH 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
The
join
utility output shall be a concatenation of selected character fields.
When the
-o
option is not specified, the output shall be:
"%s%s%s\n", <join field>, <other file1 fields>,
    <other file2 fields>
If the join field is not the first field in a file, the
<other file fields> for that file shall be:
<fields preceding join field>, <fields following join field>
When the
-o
option is specified, the output format shall be:
"%s\n", <concatenation of fields>
where the concatenation of fields is described by the
-o
option, above.

For either format, each field (except the last) shall be written with
its trailing separator character. If the separator is the default (c
<blank>
characters), a single
<space>
shall be written after each field (except the last).
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
All input files were output successfully.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
Pathnames consisting of numeric digits or of the form
string.string
should not be specified directly following the
-o
list.
EXAMPLES
The
-o
0 field essentially selects the union of the join fields. For example,
given file
phone :
!Name           Phone Number
Don             +1 123-456-7890
Hal             +1 234-567-8901
Yasushi         +2 345-678-9012
and file
fax :
!Name           Fax Number
Don             +1 123-456-7899
Keith           +1 456-789-0122
Yasushi         +2 345-678-9011
(where the large expanses of white space are meant to each represent a
single
<tab>),
the command:
join -t "<tab>" -a 1 -a 2 -e '(unknown)' -o 0,1.2,2.2 phone fax
would produce:
!Name           Phone Number            Fax Number
Don             +1 123-456-7890         +1 123-456-7899
Hal             +1 234-567-8901         (unknown)
Keith           (unknown)               +1 456-789-0122
Yasushi         +2 345-678-9012         +2 345-678-9011
Multiple instances of the same key will produce combinatorial results.
The following:
fa:
    a x
    a y
    a z
fb:
    a p
will produce:
a x p
a y p
a z p
And the following:
fa:
    a b c
    a d e
fb:
    a w x
    a y z
    a o p
will produce:
a b c w x
a b c y z
a b c o p
a d e w x
a d e y z
a d e o p
RATIONALE
The
-e
option is only effective when used with
-o
because, unless specific fields are identified using
-o ,
join
is not aware of what fields might be empty. The exception to this is
the join field, but identifying an empty join field with the
-e
string is not historical practice and some scripts might break if this
were changed.

The 0 field in the
-o
list was adopted from the Tenth Edition version of
join
to satisfy international objections that the
join
in the base documents does not support the ``full join'' or ``outer
join'' described in relational database literature. Although it has
been possible to include a join field in the output (by default, or by
field number using
-o ),
the join field could not be included for an unpaired line selected by
-a .
The
-o
0 field essentially selects the union of the join fields.

This sort of outer join was not possible with the
join
commands in the base documents. The
-o
0 field was chosen because it is an upwards-compatible change for
applications. An alternative was considered: have the join field
represent the union of the fields in the files (where they are
identical for matched lines, and one or both are null for unmatched
lines). This was not adopted because it would break some historical
applications.

The ability to specify
file2
as
-
is not historical practice; it was added for completeness.

The
-v
option is not historical practice, but was considered necessary because
it permitted the writing of
only
those lines that do not match on the join field, as opposed to the
-a
option, which prints both lines that do and do not match. This
additional facility is parallel with the
-v
option of
grep .

Some historical implementations have been encountered where a blank
line in one of the input files was considered to be the end of the
file; the description in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 does not cite this as an allowable case.

Earlier versions of this standard allowed
-j ,
-j1 ,
-j2
options, and a form of the
-o
option that allowed the
list
option-argument to be multiple arguments. These forms are no longer
specified by POSIX.1-2008 but may be present in some implementations.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
