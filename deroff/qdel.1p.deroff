NAME
qdel
-- delete batch jobs
SYNOPSIS
qdel job_identifier...

DESCRIPTION
A batch job is deleted by sending a request to the batch server that
manages the batch job. A batch job that has been deleted is no longer
subject to management by batch services.

The
qdel
utility is a user-accessible client of batch services that requests the
deletion of one or more batch jobs.

The
qdel
utility shall request a batch server to delete those batch jobs for
which a batch
job_identifier
is presented to the utility.

The
qdel
utility shall delete batch jobs in the order in which their batch
job_identifier s
are presented to the utility.

If the
qdel
utility fails to process any batch
job_identifier
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining batch
job_identifier s,
if any.

The
qdel
utility shall delete each batch job by sending a
Delete Job Request
to the batch server that manages the batch job.

The
qdel
utility shall not exit until the batch job corresponding to each
successfully processed batch
job_identifier
has been deleted.
OPTIONS
None.
OPERANDS
The
qdel
utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax
for a batch
job_identifier
(see
Section 3.3.1 ,  Batch Job Identifier).
STDIN
Not used.
INPUT FILES
None.
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
qdel :
LANG 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1-2008,
Section 8.2 ,  Internationalization Variables
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
LC_CTYPE 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
LC_MESSAGES 10

Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
LOGNAME 10
Determine the login name of the user.
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
Default.
STDOUT
An implementation of the
qdel
utility may write informative messages to standard output.
STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
OUTPUT FILES
None.
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
None.
EXIT STATUS
The following exit values shall be returned:
 0 6
Successful completion.
>0 6
An error occurred.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
In addition to the default behavior, the
qdel
utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates that
the batch
job_identifier
does not exist on the server. Whether or not the
qdel
utility waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to
locate the job on other servers is implementation-defined.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE
None.
EXAMPLES
None.
RATIONALE
The
qdel
utility allows users and administrators to delete jobs.

The
qdel
utility provides functionality that is not otherwise available. For
example, the
kill
utility of the operating system does not suffice. First, to use the
kill
utility, the user might have to log in on a remote node, because the
kill
utility does not operate across the network. Second, unlike
qdel ,
kill
cannot remove jobs from queues. Lastly, the arguments of the
qdel
utility are job identifiers rather than process identifiers, and so
this utility can be passed the output of the
qselect
utility, thus providing users with a means of deleting a list of jobs.

Because a set of jobs can be selected using the
qselect
utility, the
qdel
utility has not been complicated with options that provide for
selection of jobs. Instead, the batch jobs to be deleted are identified
individually by their job identifiers.

Historically, the
qdel
utility has been a component of NQS, the existing practice on which it
is based. However, the
qdel
utility defined in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 does not provide an option for specifying a
signal number to send to the batch job prior to the killing of the
process; that capability has been subsumed by the
qsig
utility.

A discussion was held about the delays of networking and the
possibility that the batch server may never respond, due to a down
router, down batch server, or other network mishap. The DESCRIPTION
records this under the words ``fails to process any job identifier''.
In the broad sense, the network problem is also an error, which causes
the failure to process the batch job identifier.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The
qdel
utility may be removed in a future version.
