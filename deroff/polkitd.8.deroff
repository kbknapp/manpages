NAME
polkitd - The polkit system daemon
SYNOPSIS

polkitd
DESCRIPTION

polkitd
provides the
org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1
D-Bus service on the system message bus. Users or administrators should never need to start this daemon as it will be automatically started by
dbus-daemon(1)
or
systemd(1)
whenever an application calls into the service.

polkitd
must be started with superuser privileges but drops privileges early by switching to the unprivileged
polkitd
system user.

See the
polkit(8)
man page for more information.
