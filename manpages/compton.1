\fIWM_TRANSIENT_FOR\fR
to group windows, and consider windows in the same group focused at the same time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-detect\-client\-leader\fR
.RS 4
Use

WIDTH,HEIGHT,ELE1,ELE2,ELE3,ELE4,ELE5\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
In other words, the matrix is formatted as a list of comma separated numbers\&. The first two numbers must be integers, which specify the width and height of the matrix\&. They must be odd numbers\&. Then, the following
\fIwidth * height \- 1\fR
numbers specifies the numbers in the matrix, row by row, excluding the center element\&.
.sp
The elements are finite floating point numbers\&. The decimal pointer has to be
\fI\&.\fR
(a period), and scientific notation is not supported\&.
.sp
The element in the center will either be 1\&.0 or changing based on opacity, depending on whether you have
\-\-blur\-background\-fixed\&. Yet the automatic adjustment of blur factor may not work well with a custom blur kernel\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-resize\-damage\fR \fIINTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Resize damaged region by a specific number of pixels\&. A positive value enlarges it while a negative one shrinks it\&. If the value is positive, those additional pixels will not be actually painted to screen, only used in blur calculation, and such\&. (Due to technical limitations, with
\fB\-\-use\-damage\fR, those pixels will still be incorrectly painted to screen\&.) Primarily used to fix the line corruption issues of blur, in which case you should use the blur radius value here (e\&.g\&. with a 3x3 kernel, you should use
\fB\-\-resize\-damage\fR
1, with a 5x5 one you use
\fB\-\-resize\-damage\fR
2, and so on)\&. May or may not work with
\-\-glx\-no\-stencil\&. Shrinking doesn\(cqt function correctly\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-shadow\-exclude\-reg\fR \fIGEOMETRY\fR

glx
(OpenGL) backend performs all rendering operations with OpenGL\&. It is more friendly to some VSync methods, and has significantly superior performance on color inversion (\-\-invert\-color\-include) or blur (\-\-blur\-background)\&. It requires proper OpenGL 2\&.0 support from your driver and hardware\&. You may wish to look at the GLX performance optimization options below\&.
\-\-xrender\-sync\-fence

xr_glx_hybrid
backend renders the updated screen contents with X Render and presents it on the screen with GLX\&. It attempts to address the rendering issues some users encountered with GLX backend and enables the better VSync of GLX backends\&.
\-\-vsync\-use\-glfinish
might fix some rendering issues with this backend\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-glx\-no\-stencil\fR
.RS 4
GLX backend: Avoid using stencil buffer, useful if you don\(cqt have a stencil buffer\&. Might cause incorrect opacity when rendering transparent content (but never practically happened) and may not work with

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-glx\-no\-rebind\-pixmap\fR

Use the damage information to limit rendering to parts of the screen that has actually changed\&. Potentially improves the performance\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-xrender\-sync\-fence\fR

.RE
.SH "FORMAT OF CONDITIONS"
.sp
Some options accept a condition string to match certain windows\&. A condition string is formed by one or more conditions, joined by logical operators\&.
.sp
A condition with "exists" operator looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.nf
<NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE> <NEGATION> <OPERATOR> <PATTERN>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fINEGATION\fR (optional) is one or more exclamation marks;
.sp
\fITARGET\fR is either a predefined target name, or the name of a window property to match\&. Supported predefined targets are id, x, y, x2 (x + widthb), y2, width, height, widthb (width + 2 * border_width), heightb, override_redirect, argb (whether the window has an ARGB visual), focused, wmwin (whether the window looks like a WM window, i\&.e\&. has no child window with WM_STATE and is not override\-redirected), bounding_shaped, rounded_corners (requires \fB\-\-detect\-rounded\-corners\fR), client (ID of client window), window_type (window type in string), leader (ID of window leader), name, class_g (= WM_CLASS[1]), class_i (= WM_CLASS[0]), and role\&.
.sp
\fICLIENT/FRAME\fR is a single @ if the window attribute should be be looked up on client window, nothing if on frame window;
.sp
\fIINDEX\fR (optional) is the index number of the property to look up\&. For example, [2] means look at the third value in the property\&. Do not specify it for predefined targets\&.
.sp
\fIFORMAT\fR (optional) specifies the format of the property, 8, 16, or 32\&. On absence we use format X reports\&. Do not specify it for predefined or string targets\&.
.sp
\fITYPE\fR is a single character representing the type of the property to match for: c for \fICARDINAL\fR, a for \fIATOM\fR, w for \fIWINDOW\fR, d for \fIDRAWABLE\fR, s for \fISTRING\fR (and any other string types, such as \fIUTF8_STRING\fR)\&. Do not specify it for predefined targets\&.
.sp
\fIOP QUALIFIER\fR (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be ? (ignore\-case)\&.
.sp
\fIMATCH TYPE\fR (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be nothing (exact match), * (match anywhere), ^ (match from start), % (wildcard), or ~ (PCRE regular expression)\&.
.sp
\fIOPERATOR\fR is one of = (equals), <, >, <=, =>, or nothing (exists)\&. Exists operator checks whether a property exists on a window (but for predefined targets, exists means != 0 then)\&.
.sp
\fIPATTERN\fR is either an integer or a string enclosed by single or double quotes\&. Python\-3\-style escape sequences and raw string are supported in the string format\&.
.sp
Supported logical operators are && (and) and || (or)\&. && has higher precedence than ||, left\-to\-right associativity\&. Use parentheses to change precedence\&.
.sp

\fITARGET\fR is one of "n" (window name), "i" (window class instance), "g" (window general class), and "r" (window role)\&.

\fITYPE\fR is one of "e" (exact match), "a" (match anywhere), "s" (match from start), "w" (wildcard), and "p" (PCRE regular expressions, if compiled with the support)\&.

\fIFLAGS\fR could be a series of flags\&. Currently the only defined flag is "i" (ignore case)\&.

\fIPATTERN\fR is the actual pattern string\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
.sp
compton could read from a configuration file if libconfig support is compiled in\&. If \fB\-\-config\fR is not used, compton will seek for a configuration file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/compton\&.conf (~/\&.config/compton\&.conf, usually), then ~/\&.compton\&.conf, then compton\&.conf under $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (often /etc/xdg/compton\&.conf)\&.
.sp
compton uses general libconfig configuration file format\&. A sample configuration file is available as compton\&.sample\&.conf in the source tree\&. Most of commandline switches can be used as options in configuration file as well\&. For example, \fB\-\-vsync\fR option documented above can be set in the configuration file using `vsync = `\&. Command line options will always overwrite the settings in the configuration file\&.

\fIWINDOW_TYPE\fR is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard: "unknown", "desktop", "dock", "toolbar", "menu", "utility", "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu", "tooltip", "notify", "combo", and "dnd"\&.
.PP
Following per window\-type options are available:
.RS 4
.PP
fade, shadow
.RS 4
Controls window\-type\-specific shadow and fade settings\&.
.RE
.PP
opacity
.RS 4
Controls default opacity of the window type\&.
.RE
.PP
focus
.RS 4
Controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused\&. (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on\&.)
.RE
.PP
full\-shadow
.RS 4
Controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window that you normally won\(cqt be able to see\&. Useful when the window has parts of it transparent, and you want shadows in those areas\&.
.RE
.PP
redir\-ignore
.RS 4
Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen to become redirected again after been unredirected\&. If you have
\fB\-\-unredir\-if\-possible\fR
set, and doesn\(cqt want certain window to cause unnecessary screen redirection, you can set this to
true\&.

.SH "D\-BUS API"

It\(cqs possible to control compton via D\-Bus messages, by running compton with \fB\-\-dbus\fR and send messages to com\&.github\&.chjj\&.compton\&.<DISPLAY>\&. <DISPLAY> is the display used by compton, with all non\-alphanumeric characters transformed to underscores\&. For DISPLAY=:0\&.0 you should use com\&.github\&.chjj\&.compton\&._0_0, for example\&.
