.SH NAME
cert-to-efi-sig-list - tool for converting openssl certificates to EFI signature lists
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cert-to-efi-sig-list
[\fI\,-g <guid>\/\fR] \fI\,<crt file> <efi sig list file>\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Take an input X509 certificate (in PEM format) and convert it to an EFI
signature list file containing only that single certificate
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-g\fR <guid>
Use <guid> as the owner of the signature. If this is not
supplied, an all zero guid will be used
.SH EXAMPLES

To take a standard X509 certificate in PEM format and
produce an output EFI signature list file, simply do

cert-to-efi-sig-list PK.crt PK.esl

Note that the format of EFI signature list files is such
that they can simply be concatenated to produce a file with
multiple signatures:

cat PK1.esl PK2.esl > PK.esl

If your platform has a setup mode key manipulation ability,
the keys will often only be displayed by GUID, so using the
-g option to give your keys recognisable GUIDs will be
useful if you plan to manage lots of keys.

authenticated update to EFI secure variables when the EFI
system is in user mode.
