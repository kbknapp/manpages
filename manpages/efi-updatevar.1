.SH NAME
efi-updatevar - tool for updating secure variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B efi-updatevar:
[\fI\,-a\/\fR] [\fI\,-e\/\fR] [\fI\,-d <list>\/\fR[\fI\,-<entry>\/\fR]] [\fI\,-k <key>\/\fR] [\fI\,-g <guid>\/\fR] [\fI\,-b <file>|-f <file>|-c file\/\fR] \fI\,<var>\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION

Takes a variety of input files and adds them to one of the UEFI secure boot
signature or key databases.

Note that the efivarfs filesystem must be mounted somewhere on the box
and efi-updatevars must have the ability to write to the files (this
usually means it must run as root).
.PP
Manipulate the UEFI key database via the efivarfs filesystem

.SH EXAMPLES

Assuming you own your own platform key and have the PK.auth and
noPK.auth files which go with it, you can programmatically move the
system out of User Mode by doing

efi-updatevar -f noPK.auth PK

and put it back again with

efi-updatevar -f PK.auth PK

To add the hash of an efi binary bin.efi to db in Setup Mode do

efi-updatevar -b bin.efi db

And to append an EFI signature list append.esl to db in Setup Mode do

efi-updatevar -a -e append.esl db

To add your key (KEK.crt) to the Key Exchange Key in User Mode,
assuming the private part of the platform key is in PK.key, do

efi-updatevar -a -c KEK.crt -k PK.key KEK

To add certificate DB.crt to db in User Mode assuming the private part
of the Key Exchange Key (KEK) is in KEK.key do

efi-updatevar -a -c DB.crt -k KEK.key db

To replace the old platform key (PK) with a new one in newPK.crt in
User Mode assuming the private part of the old platform key is in
PK.key, do

efi-updatevar -c newPK.crt -k PK.key db

To delete the private key, tipping the platform from User Mode to
Setup Mode, do

efi-updatevar -d 0 -k PK.key PK

And to put the private key back again (in Setup Mode) do

efi-updatevar -c PK.crt -k PK.key PK
