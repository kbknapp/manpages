.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtilix\fP is an advanced GTK3 tiling terminal emulator designed to adhere to GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.
.SH OPTIONS
The \fBtilix\fP application accepts the following command line parameters:
.TP
.B \-h \-\-help 
Show help options.
.TP

.TP
.B \-t \-\-title=TITLE
Set the title of the new terminal.
.TP
.B \-s \-\-session=SESSION_NAME
Specify a previously saved session to re-load the layout and layout options from. This will not restore the terminal to where it was left off, rather new terminals are created.
.TP
.B \-a \-\-action=ACTION_NAME
Perform one of the following actions in the current Tilix instance:
.IP
.B session-add-right
Add a new terminal rightwards of the current one.
.IP

Add a new terminal below the current terminal.

.IP
.B app-new-window
Create a new Tilix window.
.TP
.B \-e \-\-command=COMMAND
Execute all text after this parameter as a command, thus this parameter must be the last parameter.
.TP

.TP
.B \-\-minimize

.TP
.B \-\-full\-screen
Full-screen the terminal window.

Do not show client side decorations and toolbar.

.TP
.B \-\-new\-process
Start an additional Tilix instance as a new process. By default and as per GTK+ version 3 guidelines, Tilix maintains a single process that all windows belong to. This option forces Tilix to start as a separate process. This is not recommended and only intended for debugging purposes. Its use will prevent different Tilix windows from communicating with each other.

Set the window size; for example: 80x24, or 80x24+200+200 (COLSxROWS+X+Y).
