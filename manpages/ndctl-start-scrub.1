.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
NVDIMM Address Range Scrub is a capability provided by platform firmware
that allows for the discovery of memory errors by system software. It
enables system software to pre\-emptively avoid accesses that could lead
to uncorrectable memory error handling events, and it otherwise allows
memory errors to be enumerated.
.sp
The kernel provides a sysfs file (\fIscrub\fP) that when written with the
string "1\(rsn" initiates an ARS operation. The \fIndctl start\-scrub\fP
operation starts an ARS, across all specified buses, and the kernel in
turn proceeds to scrub every persistent memory address region on the
specified buses.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
Start a scrub on all nvdimm buses in the system. The json listing report
only includes the buses that support ARS operations.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
# ndctl start\-scrub

    "scrub_state":"active"
  }
]

.sp
When specifying an individual bus, or if there is only one bus in the
system, the command reports whether ARS support is available.
.sp

.nf
# ndctl start\-scrub e820
error starting scrub: Operation not supported
