.SH "THEORY OF OPERATION"
.sp
The capacity of an NVDIMM REGION (contiguous span of persistent memory)
is accessed via one or more NAMESPACE devices. REGION is the Linux term
for what ACPI and UEFI call a DIMM\-interleave\-set, or a
system\-physical\-address\-range that is striped (by the memory controller)
across one or more memory modules.
.sp
The UEFI specification defines the \fINVDIMM Label Protocol\fP as the
combination of label area access methods and a data format for
provisioning one or more NAMESPACE objects from a REGION. Note that
label support is optional and if Linux does not detect the label
capability it will automatically instantiate a "label\-less" namespace
per region. Examples of label\-less namespaces are the ones created by
the kernel\(cqs \fImemmap=ss!nn\fP command line option (see the nvdimm wiki on
kernel.org), or NVDIMMs without a valid \fInamespace index\fP in their label
area.
.sp
A namespace can be provisioned to operate in one of 4 modes, \fIfsdax\fP,
\fIdevdax\fP, \fIsector\fP, and \fIraw\fP. Here are the expected usage models for
these modes:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
fsdax: Filesystem\-DAX mode is the default mode of a namespace
when specifying \fIndctl create\-namespace\fP with no options. It creates
a block device (/dev/pmemX[.Y]) that supports the DAX capabilities
of Linux filesystems (xfs and ext4 to date). DAX removes the page
cache from the I/O path and allows mmap(2) to establish direct
mappings to persistent memory media. The DAX capability enables
workloads / working\-sets that would exceed the capacity of the page
cache to scale up to the capacity of persistent memory. Workloads
that fit in page cache or perform bulk data transfers may not see
benefit from DAX. When in doubt, pick this mode.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
devdax: Device\-DAX mode enables similar mmap(2) DAX mapping
capabilities as Filesystem\-DAX. However, instead of a block\-device
that can support a DAX\-enabled filesystem, this mode emits a single
character device file (/dev/daxX.Y). Use this mode to assign
persistent memory to a virtual\-machine, register persistent memory
for RDMA, or when gigantic mappings are needed.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
sector: Use this mode to host legacy filesystems that do
not checksum metadata or applications that are not prepared for torn
sectors after a crash. Expected usage for this mode is for small
boot volumes. This mode is compatible with other operating systems.

.el \{\

raw: Raw mode is effectively just a memory disk that does
not support DAX. Typically this indicates a namespace that was
created by tooling or another operating system that did not know how
to create a Linux \fIfsdax\fP or \fIdevdax\fP mode namespace. This mode is
compatible with other operating systems, but again, does not support
DAX operation.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
<namespace>
.RS 4
A \fInamespaceX.Y\fP device name. The keyword \fIall\fP can be specified to carry out
the operation on every namespace in the system, optionally filtered by region
(see \-\-region=option)
.RE
.sp
\-r, \-\-region=
.RS 4
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
A \(aqregionX\(aq device name, or a region id number. The keyword \(aqall\(aq can
be specified to carry out the operation on every region in the system,
optionally filtered by bus id (see \-\-bus= option).
.fi
.if n .RE
.RE
.sp
\-b, \-\-bus=
.RS 4
Enforce that the operation only be carried on devices that are
attached to the given bus. Where \fIbus\fP can be a provider name or a bus
id number.
.RE
.sp
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Emit debug messages for the namespace operation
.RE
.sp
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
Unless this option is specified the \fIdestroy namespace\fP
operation will fail if the namespace is presently active.
Specifying \-\-force causes the namespace to be disabled before
the operation is attempted. However, if the namespace is
mounted then the \fIdisable namespace\fP and \fIdestroy
namespace\fP operations will be aborted.  The namespace must be
unmounted before being destroyed.
